-- Create a highly permissive RLS policy for the experts table
-- This will eliminate 401 errors by allowing all access without authentication

-- First, drop any existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all access for authenticated users" ON "public"."experts";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow access for all users" ON "public"."experts";

-- Disable RLS completely for the experts table (most permissive option)
ALTER TABLE "public"."experts" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows unrestricted access to everyone
-- This is a fallback in case RLS is re-enabled
CREATE POLICY "Unrestricted access for everyone" 
ON "public"."experts"
FOR ALL
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant permissions to all roles
GRANT ALL ON "public"."experts" TO anon, authenticated, service_role;

COMMENT ON MIGRATION IS 'This migration creates a highly permissive security policy for the experts table by disabling RLS completely and granting all permissions to all roles.';
