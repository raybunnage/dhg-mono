# DeploymentService Migration Guide

## Overview
The DeploymentService has been refactored to properly extend SingletonService and follow shared service patterns.

## Migration Status
- ✅ **Refactored**: Extended SingletonService base class
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Separated types into dedicated types.ts
- ✅ **Module Structure**: Proper index.ts with exports
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained deploymentService export
- ✅ **Documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc
- ✅ **Testing**: Added test suite structure

## Key Changes

### 1. Base Class Extension
```typescript
// Before
export class DeploymentService {
  private static instance: DeploymentService;
  static getInstance(): DeploymentService {
    if (!DeploymentService.instance) {
      DeploymentService.instance = new DeploymentService();
    }
    return DeploymentService.instance;
  }
}

// After
export class DeploymentService extends SingletonService {
  static getInstance(): DeploymentService {
    return SingletonService.getInstance(DeploymentService) as DeploymentService;
  }
}
```

### 2. Module Structure
- Created proper `index.ts` with exports
- Separated types into `types.ts`
- Added backward compatibility export

### 3. Import Changes
```typescript
// Old import (still works for compatibility)
import { deploymentService } from '../../../packages/shared/services/deployment-service';

// New recommended import
import { DeploymentService } from '@shared/services/deployment-service-refactored';
const deploymentService = DeploymentService.getInstance();
```

## Breaking Changes
None - Full backward compatibility maintained.

## Features
- **Validation Pipeline**: TypeScript, dependencies, environment, build, tests
- **Deployment Targets**: Staging and production environments
- **Rollback Support**: Full rollback capabilities with commit tracking
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment health monitoring
- **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive deployment history and status

## Database Dependencies
The service requires these database tables:
- `deployment_runs`
- `deployment_validations`
- `deployment_health_checks`
- `deployment_rollbacks`
- `deployment_status_view`

## Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm test packages/shared/services/deployment-service-refactored/DeploymentService.test.ts
```

## Next Steps
1. Update deployment-cli.ts to use the refactored service
2. Create database migrations for required tables
3. Add integration tests with mock Supabase client
4. Consider adding deployment webhooks for CI/CD integration
