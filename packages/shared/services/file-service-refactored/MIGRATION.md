# FileService Migration Documentation

## Migration Summary
- **Service**: FileService
- **Migration Date**: 2025-06-14
- **Migration Type**: Refactoring to extend SingletonService
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Breaking Changes**: ⚠️ Yes - Export pattern changed

## What Was Migrated

### Original Implementation Issues
1. **Direct instance export** - Exported as `export const fileService = new FileService()`
2. **No base class** - Didn't extend from standard base classes
3. **No singleton pattern** - Just a plain class with exported instance
4. **Limited error handling** - Basic Logger.error without proper abstraction
5. **No metrics tracking** - No visibility into service performance or usage
6. **No health checks** - No way to monitor service health
7. **No resource cleanup** - processedDriveIds never cleared properly
8. **Mixed concerns** - Google Drive operations mixed with local file operations

### Refactored Implementation  
1. **Extends SingletonService** - Proper infrastructure service with singleton pattern
2. **Clean singleton pattern** - Uses getInstance() method with optional logger
3. **Comprehensive error handling** - All errors logged with context and tracked in metrics
4. **Metrics tracking** - Tracks files read/written, bytes processed, Google Drive traversals
5. **Health check support** - File system accessibility verification
6. **Resource management** - Proper cleanup in releaseResources method
7. **Better separation** - Clear distinction between file system and Google Drive operations
8. **Performance tracking** - Detailed metrics for all operations

## Key Improvements

### Before (Direct Export):
```typescript
export class FileService {
  private processedDriveIds = new Set<string>();
  
  // Methods...
}

// Export a singleton instance
export const fileService = new FileService();
```

### After (SingletonService Pattern):
```typescript
export class FileService extends SingletonService {
  private static instance: FileService;
  
  protected constructor(logger?: Logger) {
    super('FileService', logger);
  }
  
  public static getInstance(logger?: Logger): FileService {
    return SingletonService.getSingletonInstance(
      'FileService',
      () => new FileService(logger)
    );
  }
  
  protected async releaseResources(): Promise<void> {
    this.processedDriveIds.clear();
  }
}
```

## Migration Path

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Export Pattern Changed

### For Browser/CLI Applications:
```typescript
// Before
import { fileService } from '@shared/services/file-service';
fileService.readFile('/path/to/file');

// After
import { FileService } from '@shared/services/file-service-refactored';
const fileService = FileService.getInstance();
fileService.readFile('/path/to/file');
```

### With Custom Logger:
```typescript
// Before - No logger support
import { fileService } from '@shared/services/file-service';

// After - Logger support
import { FileService } from '@shared/services/file-service-refactored';
const fileService = FileService.getInstance(customLogger);
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Singleton pattern verification
- ✅ Health check functionality
- ✅ Google Drive traversal operations
- ✅ File system operations (read, write, exists)
- ✅ Directory operations
- ✅ File search functionality
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Metrics tracking
- ✅ Resource cleanup

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test FileService.test.ts
```

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
ts-node packages/shared/services/file-service-refactored/benchmark.ts
```

## Performance Impact

### Improvements
- **Better resource management** - processedDriveIds cleared on reset/shutdown
- **Performance metrics** - Track bytes read/written, operation counts
- **Efficient singleton** - Reuses instance across application
- **Observable performance** - Detailed metrics for monitoring

### Benchmark Results (Example)
```
1. Health Check Performance:
   ✓ Health check: 5ms (healthy: true)

2. File Write Operations:
   ✓ Write file (30000 bytes): 12ms

3. File Read Operations:
   ✓ Read file: 8ms (30000 bytes)

4. File Existence Check:
   ✓ Check file exists: 1ms (exists: true)

5. Directory Operations:
   ✓ Create 10 directories: 15ms

6. File Search Operations:
   ✓ Find files (*.txt): 4ms (found: 6 files)

8. Bulk File Operations:
   ✓ Write 100 files: 125ms
   ✓ Read 100 files: 95ms (1200 bytes total)
```

## API Compatibility

The refactored service maintains API compatibility for all methods except initialization:
- All public methods have the same signatures
- All return types are identical
- Error handling behavior is preserved
- **Breaking change**: Must use getInstance() instead of imported instance

## Additional Features

The refactored service adds:
1. **Health checks** - Monitor file system accessibility
2. **Metrics** - Track all operations and performance
3. **Better logging** - Structured logging with levels
4. **Resource management** - Proper cleanup of cached data
5. **Performance tracking** - Bytes read/written, operation counts

## Node.js Dependencies

This service uses Node.js-specific modules (fs, path) for file operations. It is designed for CLI and server environments only and should not be used in browser contexts.

## Google Drive Integration

The service includes comprehensive Google Drive operations:
- Recursive folder traversal with depth control
- High-level folder discovery
- MP4 file search functionality
- Progress callbacks for long operations
- Duplicate prevention with processedDriveIds tracking

All Google Drive operations require a Supabase client to be passed as a parameter.
