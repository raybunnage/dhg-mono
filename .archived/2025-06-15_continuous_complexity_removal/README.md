# Archived: Continuous Deployment Over-Engineering

**Date**: 2025-06-15
**Reason**: Zero usage after 60+ days (0 records in all 5 tables)
**Original Purpose**: Automated evaluation and tracking of development scenarios
**Why It Failed**: Over-engineered before proving basic value; built tracking before having anything to track

## Contents

### Database Tables (0 records each)
- continuous_improvement_scenarios
- scenario_attempts  
- scenario_executions
- continuous_development_scenarios
- sys_continuous_improvement_scenarios

### Complex Infrastructure Removed
- `critical-evaluator.ts` - 619-line evaluation system with no usage
- `scenario-dependencies.ts` - Complex dependency analysis
- `track-scenario-execution.ts` - Execution tracking for scenarios never run
- `run-scenario.ts` - Automated runner for manual-first processes
- `discover-inventory.ts` - System discovery tools
- Complex migrations creating unused tables

### Files Archived
Total: 14 TypeScript files, ~2,500+ lines of code

## How to Restore

1. Copy files back from this directory to their original locations
2. Re-run the complex migrations:
   ```bash
   ts-node scripts/cli-pipeline/database/commands/run-migration.ts \
     supabase/migrations/20250615_create_continuous_improvement_scenarios.sql
   ```
3. Update imports in any files that referenced the removed code
4. Rebuild TypeScript: `pnpm tsc`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Build After Validation**: We built evaluation before having scenarios to evaluate
2. **Manual First**: Automation only makes sense after manual process is proven
3. **Usage Before Features**: Need actual users before building tracking systems
4. **Start Simple**: Complex systems often die from their own weight
5. **Data Drives Decisions**: 0 records after 60 days tells the whole story

## What We're Doing Instead

Implementing minimal system with:
- 1 simple table (scenario_attempts) 
- 3 CLI commands (list, run, done)
- 4 basic markdown scenarios
- Manual process to prove value first

## Industry Validation

This removal aligns with practices at:
- **GitHub**: Started simple, added based on usage
- **Stripe**: Famous for minimal initial implementations  
- **Basecamp**: Actively removes features with <10% usage

## Quote to Remember

"Complexity is earned, not assumed." - We assumed we needed complexity before earning it through usage.
