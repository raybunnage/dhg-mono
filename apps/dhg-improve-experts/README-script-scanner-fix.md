# Script Scanner Fix

## Overview
This README provides instructions for fixing and running the script scanner functionality which was previously encountering errors.

## Issues Fixed
1. Environment variable handling - The CLI was looking for `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` but only `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` was available
2. Error handler implementation - The wrong import was used for the error handler
3. Logger implementation - The logger was imported incorrectly
4. Missing file scanning functionality - The required `findFiles` method was not properly implemented
5. Build process issues - TypeScript compilation had errors for related files

## Solution
Rather than fixing all the TypeScript errors across multiple files, we created a solution focused on fixing just the `scan-scripts` command, which is the first step in the script analysis pipeline.

## Scripts
The following scripts have been created to fix and run the scanner:

### 1. `fix-permissions.sh`
This script directly creates a working JavaScript implementation of the scan-scripts command in the CLI dist directory. It:
- Creates minimal implementations of required utilities
- Adds the environment variable fallback mechanism
- Sets up the command structure correctly

Run this script first to set up the environment.

### 2. `run-scan-scripts.sh`
This script runs the scan-scripts command with appropriate parameters:
- Scans the entire mono repo for script files
- Excludes node_modules, dist, build directories 
- Outputs results to script-scan-results.json
- Shows a summary of found scripts

## Usage Instructions

1. First run the fix script:
   ```bash
   ./fix-permissions.sh
   ```

2. Then run the scanner:
   ```bash
   ./run-scan-scripts.sh
   ```

3. The scan results will be saved to:
   ```
   /Users/raybunnage/Documents/github/dhg-mono/script-scan-results.json
   ```

4. After successful scanning, you can proceed with the next steps in the script analysis pipeline.

## Note on Complete Fix
This solution focuses on fixing the `scan-scripts` command, which is the first step in the script analysis pipeline. To fix the complete analysis pipeline, additional work would be needed on the `analyze-script` and `batch-analyze-scripts` commands, which have their own separate issues.

## Technical Details
The fix works by:
1. Creating a properly formatted JavaScript implementation of the scan-scripts command
2. Installing it directly in the CLI's dist directory
3. Adding environment variable handling to ensure Supabase keys are properly recognized
4. Using the glob package for efficient file scanning

This approach bypasses TypeScript compilation issues while providing a working implementation of the scanning functionality.
