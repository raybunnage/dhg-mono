## üìã INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH WORKTREE AGENT

### Common Process for All Agents:
1. **Create your assigned worktree** and switch to it
2. **For each service in your list**:
   - First check if the service actually exists at the specified path
   - Check for duplicates by searching for similar functionality
   - If it's a real service that needs refactoring, proceed with the 4-checkpoint migration:
     - `baseline` - Before any changes
     - `migrated` - Service refactored to extend appropriate base class
     - `validated` - Tests created and passing
     - `finalized` - Documentation created, database updated, old service archived

### Base Class Selection Guide:
- **SingletonService**: For infrastructure services managing expensive resources (APIs, databases, external services)
- **BusinessService**: For business logic services with dependency injection patterns

### What to Exclude (Don't Refactor):
- Services that are just type files (types.ts)
- Services that are utility functions or clients
- Services that don't actually exist at the specified path
- Services that are clear duplicates of others

### Documentation Requirements:
- Create `MIGRATION.md` for each refactored service
- Update database record with migration completion
- Archive original service with date stamp

### Commit Pattern:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint: [stage] - [ServiceName] migration [step]"
```

### Database Update Pattern:
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('sys_shared_services')
  .update({
    migration_status: 'completed',
    migration_completed_at: now,
    service_path: 'service-name-refactored/',
    base_class_type: 'SingletonService|BusinessService',
    service_type: 'infrastructure|business'
  })
  .eq('service_name', 'ServiceName');
```
