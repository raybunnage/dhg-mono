# Simplified Continuous Development Standards
# Version: 2.0 (Simplified 2025-06-15)
# Previous version archived due to over-complexity

# Core principle: Start simple, add only what breaks

standards:
  # What we actually enforce
  database:
    - Use table prefixes from sys_table_prefixes
    - Document new tables in sys_table_definitions
    - No hardcoded IDs (use UUIDs)
  
  code:
    - No hardcoded credentials
    - Use shared services from packages/shared
    - Run tsc --noEmit before committing
  
  process:
    - Manual process must work before automating
    - Get 10+ successful runs before adding complexity
    - Archive unused code after 30 days of zero usage

# What we measure (keep it simple)
track_only:
  - Scenario completion time
  - Success/failure rate
  - What actually gets used

# What we DON'T need (learned the hard way)
avoid:
  - Evaluation systems before usage
  - Tracking before having data
  - Automation before manual success
  - Complex standards nobody follows

# Philosophy
remember: |
  "Complexity is earned, not assumed."
  If you can't explain it in one sentence, it's too complex.
