# Code Archival Strategy for Continuous Improvement

## The Problem

Old, unused, and experimental code is polluting our continuous improvement analysis:

1. **False Positives**: Discovery finds old services that shouldn't be registered
2. **Noise in Metrics**: Usage analysis includes dead code 
3. **Wasted Effort**: Time spent analyzing code that doesn't matter
4. **Incorrect Decisions**: Keeping/removing wrong services based on stale data
5. **Duplicate Creation**: Scanner finds old implementations and creates registry entries

## The Solution: Pre-Archival Before Continuous Improvement

**Principle**: Only analyze code that's actually part of the current system

### Phase 1: Identify What to Archive

#### Automatic Detection Criteria
```typescript
// Code that should be archived:
- Files/directories with "old", "backup", "temp" in name
- Files not modified in 90+ days with zero imports
- Services with 0 usage and no recent commits
- Duplicate implementations (keep the actively used one)
- Experimental/prototype code not in production
- Code with TODO/FIXME that's been there 60+ days
```

#### Manual Review Criteria  
- Features that were built but never deployed
- Services that were replaced by newer implementations
- Test fixtures that are no longer used
- Documentation for removed features

### Phase 2: Archival Structure

```
.archived/
├── YYYY-MM-DD_archive_reason/
│   ├── archived_manifest.md
│   ├── services/
│   ├── scripts/
│   ├── docs/
│   └── tests/
```

**Example:**
```
.archived/
├── 2025-06-13_duplicate_services/
│   ├── archived_manifest.md
│   ├── GoogleDriveService/           # Duplicate of GoogleDrive
│   ├── LightAuthEnhancedService/     # Replaced by LightAuthService
│   └── PDFProcessorService/          # Duplicate of PdfProcessorService
├── 2025-06-10_experimental_features/
│   ├── archived_manifest.md
│   ├── ai-auto-classification/       # Experiment that didn't work
│   └── real-time-sync/              # Prototype never deployed
```

### Phase 3: Archive Process

#### Before Every Continuous Improvement Cycle:

1. **Detection Pass**
   ```bash
   ./continuous-cli.sh archive-detection
   ```

2. **Review & Confirm**
   ```bash
   ./continuous-cli.sh archive-review
   ```

3. **Execute Archival**
   ```bash
   ./continuous-cli.sh archive-execute
   ```

4. **Verify Clean State**
   ```bash
   ./continuous-cli.sh verify-clean
   ```

5. **Run Continuous Improvement**
   ```bash
   ./continuous-cli.sh daily
   ```

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Archive Detection Tool

```typescript
interface ArchivalCandidate {
  path: string;
  reason: string;
  confidence: number;
  lastModified: Date;
  usageCount: number;
  isDuplicate: boolean;
}

class ArchivalDetector {
  detectCandidates(): ArchivalCandidate[] {
    // Find old, unused, duplicate code
  }
}
```

### 2. Safe Archival Process

```bash
# 1. Create archive directory with timestamp
mkdir -p .archived/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_pre_improvement_cleanup

# 2. Move (don't delete) candidates
mv old_service .archived/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_pre_improvement_cleanup/

# 3. Create manifest of what was archived and why
echo "Archived old_service: Duplicate of new_service" >> manifest.md

# 4. Update any references to point to kept version
# 5. Test that system still works
# 6. Commit the clean state
```

### 3. Archive Manifest Template

```markdown
# Archive Manifest: YYYY-MM-DD

## Reason: Pre-continuous-improvement cleanup

## Archived Items:

### Services
- **GoogleDriveService** → Replaced by GoogleDrive (2 apps using it)
- **LightAuthEnhancedService** → Replaced by LightAuthService (1 app using it)

### Scripts  
- **old-classify-docs.ts** → Replaced by unified-classification-service

### Documentation
- **OLD_API_DOCS.md** → Replaced by current API documentation

## Safety Checks Performed:
- [x] No active imports to archived code
- [x] All apps still compile
- [x] All tests still pass
- [x] Service registry updated

## Recovery Instructions:
If archived code is needed:
1. Copy from .archived/YYYY-MM-DD_*/
2. Update imports and references
3. Re-register services if needed
```

## Benefits of Pre-Archival

### 1. Accurate Continuous Improvement
- ✅ Only analyzes active code
- ✅ Correct usage metrics
- ✅ No false duplicates
- ✅ Focus on real issues

### 2. Cleaner Codebase
- ✅ Easier navigation
- ✅ Faster builds
- ✅ Reduced confusion
- ✅ Clear intent

### 3. Better Decision Making
- ✅ Keep/remove decisions based on actual usage
- ✅ No time wasted on dead code
- ✅ Clear service ownership
- ✅ Reliable metrics

### 4. Safer Refactoring
- ✅ Know what's actually used
- ✅ Confident deletion
- ✅ Preserved history in archives
- ✅ Easy recovery if needed

## Archival Categories

### Immediate Archive (High Confidence)
- Files with "backup", "old", "temp", "copy" in name
- Services with 0 imports and 0 usage for 90+ days
- Exact duplicates of actively used code
- Experimental branches that were never merged

### Review Required (Medium Confidence)  
- Services with low usage but recent modifications
- Code that might be used in non-obvious ways
- Shared utilities that aren't clearly services
- Configuration files that might be referenced

### Keep Active (Low Confidence)
- Recently modified code
- Code with active imports
- Services registered and used by apps
- Current documentation

## Integration with Continuous Improvement

### Modified Workflow:

```bash
# Weekly Continuous Improvement Process

# 1. Pre-cleanup archival
./continuous-cli.sh archive-candidates
./continuous-cli.sh archive-execute --confirmed

# 2. Run on clean codebase  
./continuous-cli.sh daily

# 3. Results are now accurate
./continuous-cli.sh report
```

## Long-term Maintenance

### Monthly Archive Review
- Check if archived code can be permanently deleted
- Verify no one needs archived features
- Clean up old archives (keep 6 months)

### Archive Size Monitoring
- Track how much gets archived each cycle
- Large archives might indicate process issues
- Gradual reduction over time = improvement

## Success Metrics

### Before Archival System:
- 115 services (many duplicates/unused)
- Discovery creates new duplicates each run
- Uncertain what's actually used
- Waste time analyzing dead code

### After Archival System:
- ~70 active services (actual current system)
- Discovery only finds real new services
- Clear picture of usage patterns
- Focus improvement on code that matters

## Implementation Priority

**This Week**: Create archive detection tool
**Next Week**: Run first major archival before continuous improvement
**Ongoing**: Pre-archival before each improvement cycle

The continuous improvement system will be **dramatically more effective** once we're only analyzing code that's actually part of the current system.
