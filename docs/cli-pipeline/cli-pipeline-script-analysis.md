# CLI Pipeline Script Analysis

This document provides an analysis of scripts in the `scripts/cli-pipeline` directory, including their creation date, purpose, and refactoring needs.

| Filename | Creation Date | Purpose | Refactoring Needed |
|----------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| check-duplicates.ts | Early 2025 | Simple script to check for potential duplicate implementations in code | Yes - needs complete implementation using shared service approach |
| command-history-tracker.ts | Early 2025 | Tracks command execution history by wrapping commands and logging them to Supabase database | Yes - should use SupabaseClientService instead of direct client initialization |
| display-doc-paths.ts | Early 2025 | Complex script for managing documentation files - counting, checking file existence, normalizing paths, discovering new files | Yes - should use SupabaseClientService consistently, break into smaller modules |
| display-doc-paths-simple.ts | Early 2025 | Simplified version that connects to database and counts records | Minor - already uses shared services but could extract database query logic |
| display-doc-paths-enhanced.ts | Early 2025 | Enhanced version with menu system for viewing documentation files | Minor - already uses shared services pattern but could extract database query logic |
| document-summary-report.ts | Early 2025 | Generates a report of document files with summaries and status recommendations | Yes - should use SupabaseClientService and Logger/ErrorHandler from shared packages |
| prompt-lookup.ts | Early 2025 | Looks up prompts by name from the database or file system and fetches related content | Yes - should consistently use shared services pattern |
| sync-markdown-files.ts | Early 2025 | Synchronizes markdown files between the repository and documentation_files database table | Yes - should use SupabaseClientService and move sync logic to a dedicated service |
| test-script-analyzer.ts | Early 2025 | Simple script to verify Claude API key and Supabase credential setup | Minor - could use shared configuration service |
| classify-untyped-script.ts | Early 2025 | CLI script for classifying a single untyped script using ScriptManagementService | No - already uses shared service approach |
| classify-untyped-script.js | Early 2025 | JavaScript version of classify-untyped-script.ts to avoid TypeScript transpilation issues | No - already uses shared service approach |
| analyze-script.ts | Early 2025 | Analyzes a script file using Claude AI and saves classification to database | Yes - should use ClaudeService and ScriptManagementService |
| simple-script-server.js | Early 2025 | Simple HTTP server for handling script files (retrieving, listing, archiving) | Yes - should use FileService and framework like Express |
| classify-script-with-prompt.ts | Early 2025 | Advanced script classification tool using prompt lookup functionality | Yes - should use ClaudeService and ScriptManagementService |
| simple-md-server.js | Early 2025 | Simple HTTP server for handling markdown files | Yes - should use FileService and framework like Express |
| docs-archive-server.js | Early 2025 | Document file server for archiving and retrieving document files | Yes - should use FileService and DocumentService |
| document-type-manager.ts | Early 2025 | Tool for managing document types, classifying documents, and updating database | Partial - already uses some service abstractions but needs DocumentService |
| test-adapter-paths.sh | Early 2025 | Test script to verify path resolution in refactored CLI Pipeline structure | No - simple testing script |

## Refactoring Recommendations

Most scripts should be refactored to use shared services:

1. **Database Access**: Use SupabaseClientService for all database operations
2. **File Operations**: Use FileService for all file system interactions 
3. **AI Operations**: Use ClaudeService for all Claude API interactions
4. **Document Management**: Create a DocumentService to centralize document handling logic
5. **Script Management**: Leverage ScriptManagementService for script operations
6. **Server Components**: Use Express framework for all HTTP server implementations
7. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling via shared ErrorHandler
8. **Logging**: Use shared Logger service for consistent logging

The refactoring would improve:
- Code maintainability
- Testing capabilities 
- Error handling consistency
- Service reusability
- Configuration management
