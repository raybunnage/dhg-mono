# CLI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Environment Variable Issue**
   - Problem: Missing `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` when running CLI commands
   - Fix: Added fallback to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if the prefixed version is not available
   - File: `/packages/cli/src/utils/config.ts`

2. **Error Handler Issue**
   - Problem: Incorrectly importing `errorHandler` function instead of `ErrorHandler` class
   - Fix: Updated imports and function calls to use the proper `ErrorHandler.handle()` method
   - File: `/packages/cli/src/commands/scan-scripts.ts`

3. **Logger Import Issue**
   - Problem: Incorrectly importing `logger` as default export instead of named `Logger` export
   - Fix: Updated import to `import { Logger, LogLevel } from '../utils/logger'`
   - File: `/packages/cli/src/commands/scan-scripts.ts`

4. **Missing findFiles Function**
   - Problem: Missing implementation of `findFiles` function with the needed interface
   - Fix: Created proper async `findFiles` method in `FileService` class with glob support
   - File: `/packages/cli/src/services/file-service.ts`

5. **File Service Export Issue**
   - Problem: `FileService` class not properly exported for use by other modules
   - Fix: Added explicit export of the class and created instance in scan-scripts.ts
   - Files: `/packages/cli/src/services/file-service.ts` and `/packages/cli/src/commands/scan-scripts.ts`

6. **Missing Dependency**
   - Problem: Required `glob` package not in dependencies
   - Fix: Added `glob` to package.json dependencies
   - File: `/packages/cli/package.json`

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` in the CLI package directory to install the newly added glob dependency
2. Build the CLI package with the fixed code
3. Run the script analysis command from the dhg-mono root directory 

## Testing

A test script was created to verify the environment variable fix, confirming that:
- When `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is not set but `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is available
- The code correctly copies the value to the expected environment variable

## Notes

These fixes address fundamental issues in the CLI codebase that were preventing the script analysis functionality from working properly. The changes focus on:

1. Environment variable handling
2. Proper error handling
3. Module imports and exports
4. File scanning functionality

Additional fixes may be needed for the analyze-scripts and batch-analyze-scripts commands, as indicated by the TypeScript build errors.
