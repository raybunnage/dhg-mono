# CLI Error Handler Fix

## Issue
After fixing the environment variable issue, the script analysis command encountered a new error:

```
TypeError: (0 , error_handler_1.errorHandler) is not a function
```

This occurred because the `scan-scripts.ts` file was trying to import and use a non-existent `errorHandler` function from the `error-handler.ts` module.

## Fix Applied
1. Corrected the import statement to use the `ErrorHandler` class instead:

```typescript
// Changed from:
import { errorHandler } from '../utils/error-handler';

// To:
import { ErrorHandler } from '../utils/error-handler';
```

2. Updated the error handling in the catch block to use the class method:

```typescript
// Changed from:
catch (error) {
  errorHandler(error as Error);
  process.exit(1);
}

// To:
catch (error) {
  ErrorHandler.handle(error as Error, true);
}
```

The `ErrorHandler.handle` method already includes functionality to exit the process when the second parameter is set to `true`, so the explicit `process.exit(1)` call was removed.

## Root Cause
The error occurred due to a mismatch between the import statement and the actual exports in the `error-handler.ts` module. The module exports an `ErrorHandler` class with static methods rather than a standalone `errorHandler` function.

## Next Steps
1. Build the CLI package with these fixes
2. Run the script analysis command again
3. Check for any additional errors that might need fixing

## Note
It's important to ensure consistent error handling patterns across the codebase. Consider doing a broader search for any other instances of `errorHandler` imports that might need to be updated to use the `ErrorHandler` class instead.
