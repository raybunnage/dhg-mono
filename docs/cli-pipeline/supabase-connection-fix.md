# Supabase Connection Fix for Document Pipeline

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the Supabase connection issues in the document pipeline service.

## Issue Description

The document pipeline CLI command `test-connection` was failing with the following error:

```
2025-03-29T06:21:50.530Z [ERROR] Failed to connect to documentation_files table {"error":{"error":{"message":""}}}
✗ Failed to connect to Supabase
```

## Root Causes

1. The database service was not properly prioritizing the environment variables for Supabase connections
2. Error handling and reporting needed improvement to better diagnose connection issues
3. The connection test process needed enhancement to test different aspects of the connection

## Implemented Fixes

1. Enhanced the database service constructor to properly prioritize credentials:
   - Now properly checks for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in environment variables
   - Added better logging of connection parameters (with sensitive data masked)

2. Improved the `testConnection()` method to:
   - Test the auth connection first
   - Provide more detailed error information
   - Attempt alternative methods to diagnose permission issues
   - Report the count of records found when successful

3. Added diagnostic scripts:
   - Created `supabase-connection-fix.ts` to directly test the Supabase connection
   - Created `fix-connection.sh` to run the diagnostic script with proper environment variables

## Usage

When experiencing connection issues, run:

```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/document/fix-connection.sh
```

This script will:
1. Load environment variables from appropriate `.env` files
2. Check and display (masked) connection parameters
3. Run a diagnostic connection test with enhanced error reporting
4. Set proper permissions on CLI scripts

## Results

The connection test now succeeds and correctly reports:

```
Successfully connected to Supabase. Found 237 records in documentation_files table.
✓ Successfully connected to Supabase
```

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding a healthcheck command to the document pipeline CLI
2. Monitor for similar connection issues in other pipeline components
3. Add automated testing for database connections in the CI/CD pipeline
