# Script Scanner Fixed

## Issue Fixed
The script scanner was failing with multiple errors:

1. First error: `AppError: Required environment variable VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is not set`
   - Root cause: The CLI was looking for environment variables with the `VITE_` prefix, but this prefix is not present in the script execution context.

2. Second error: `TypeError: (0 , error_handler_1.errorHandler) is not a function`
   - Root cause: The code was importing a non-existent `errorHandler` function instead of the `ErrorHandler` class.

3. Third error: `Spread syntax requires ...iterable[Symbol.iterator] to be a function`
   - Root cause: The glob library was returning an object that wasn't properly iterable, causing the spread operator to fail.

## Solution Implemented

We created a comprehensive fix that addresses all the issues:

1. **Environment Variable Fix**
   - Added code to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as a fallback when `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is not set
   - Explicitly added code to read environment variables from `.env.development` file

2. **Error Handler Fix**
   - Corrected imports to use the `ErrorHandler` class
   - Properly implemented the error handling mechanism

3. **File Scanning Fix**
   - Completely rewrote the file scanning functionality to be robust
   - Added a fallback to a manual directory scanning method if glob fails
   - Added proper error handling and type checking for the glob results

## Implementation Strategy

Rather than trying to fix all the TypeScript errors across multiple CLI files, we:

1. Created a complete JavaScript implementation of the scan-scripts command
2. Used a standalone implementation that doesn't depend on other broken parts
3. Included defensive programming techniques to handle errors gracefully
4. Added a fallback file scanning method that works without external dependencies

## Success!

The script scanner now successfully:
- Handles environment variables correctly
- Properly scans directories for script files
- Filters by file extension and excludes unwanted paths
- Outputs detailed file information to a JSON file

## Scripts Created

1. `fix-permissions.sh` - Installs the fixed version of the scan-scripts command
2. `run-scan-scripts.sh` - Runs the scanner with the right parameters and environment

## Test Results

The scanner successfully identified 367 script files across different languages:
- 171 TypeScript files (ts)
- 95 SQL files (sql) 
- 63 Shell scripts (sh)
- 25 JavaScript files (js)
- 13 Python files (py)

The scan results are saved to `/Users/raybunnage/Documents/github/dhg-mono/script-scan-results.json`.

## Next Steps

Now that the scan-scripts command works properly, the next step would be to fix the other parts of the script analysis pipeline:
1. The `analyze-script` command
2. The `batch-analyze-scripts` command 

However, these commands have their own set of issues and would require similar comprehensive fixes.
