# Edit Task Modal Fix

## Problem
The edit task modal was not saving changes properly. When trying to save edits, the modal would disappear and return to the read-only view without persisting changes.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Modal Inside Link Component**: The EditTaskModal was rendered inside a React Router Link component, which caused navigation conflicts when interacting with the modal.

2. **Missing Enhanced Logging**: No console logging to help debug the save process.

3. **View Synchronization**: After updating the task, we needed to fetch from the enhanced view to get computed fields.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Modal Positioning Fix
Moved the EditTaskModal outside of the Link component to prevent navigation interference:

```tsx
return (
  <>
    <Link to={`/tasks/${task.id}`} className="...">
      {/* Card content */}
    </Link>
    
    {/* Modal now outside Link */}
    <EditTaskModal
      task={task}
      isOpen={isEditModalOpen}
      onClose={() => setIsEditModalOpen(false)}
      onSave={handleTaskUpdate}
    />
  </>
);
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track the save process:
- Log when save starts
- Log the updates being sent
- Log successful responses
- Keep modal open on errors to show error messages

### 3. Improved UX
- Added keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to close)
- Better focus management with autoFocus on title field
- Improved button states and disabled handling
- Added type="button" to prevent form submission issues
- Better visual feedback with ring focus states

### 4. Backend Improvements
- Updated service to fetch from `dev_tasks_enhanced_view` after updates
- This ensures computed fields (success criteria metrics) are current
- Fallback to basic data if enhanced view fails

### 5. Testing
Created a test script to verify update functionality works correctly at the database level.

## How to Test

1. Go to Claude Tasks page
2. Click the edit icon on any task
3. Make changes to any field (title, description, priority, etc.)
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Verify:
   - Modal closes properly
   - Changes are reflected immediately in the task list
   - No navigation occurs
   - Success criteria and other computed fields update

## Technical Details

The issue was primarily caused by event bubbling and the modal being a child of a Link component. When clicking save, the event would bubble up and trigger navigation, interrupting the save process.

By moving the modal outside the Link and adding proper event handling, the save process now completes successfully and the UI updates correctly.
