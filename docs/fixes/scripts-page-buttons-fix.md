# Scripts Page Buttons Fix

## Issue
The three buttons at the top of the Scripts Management page (Sync Scripts, Run Health Check, Run Analysis) were not functional - they had no onClick handlers.

## Root Cause
The buttons were implemented as static UI elements without any event handlers or backend integration.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added State Management
- `runningCommand`: Tracks which command is currently executing
- `commandStatus`: Shows user feedback and status messages

### 2. Created CLI Integration Functions
- `runCliCommand()`: Generic function to execute CLI commands via API
- `handleSyncScripts()`: Runs `./scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/scripts-cli.sh sync`
- `handleHealthCheck()`: Runs `./scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/scripts-cli.sh health-check`
- `handleRunAnalysis()`: Runs `./scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/scripts-cli.sh stats`

### 3. Enhanced Button Functionality
- Added onClick handlers to all three buttons
- Added loading states with disabled styling
- Added dynamic button text (e.g., "Syncing..." while running)
- Added visual feedback with status messages

### 4. Updated API Server
- Added `./scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/scripts-cli.sh` to whitelist in git-api-server.cjs
- Enables secure execution of scripts CLI commands from the UI

### 5. Added Status Display
- Real-time status messages show command progress
- Color-coded feedback (blue for success, red for errors)
- Auto-clearing status messages after 5 seconds

## Commands Now Available

1. **Sync Scripts**: Full sync of all scripts with AI classification
2. **Run Health Check**: Verify scripts pipeline health and dependencies
3. **Run Analysis**: Generate comprehensive script statistics and insights

## Usage

1. Ensure git-api-server is running: `node git-api-server.cjs`
2. Navigate to Scripts Management page
3. Click any of the three buttons to execute commands
4. Watch status messages for feedback

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/pages/ScriptsManagement.tsx` - Added button functionality
- `apps/dhg-admin-code/git-api-server.cjs` - Added scripts CLI to whitelist

### API Integration:
- Uses existing `/api/execute-command` endpoint
- Sends commands to `./scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/scripts-cli.sh`
- Handles success/error responses with user feedback

### Security:
- Commands are whitelisted on the server side
- No arbitrary command execution allowed
- 30-second timeout for command execution

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Start the API server: `cd apps/dhg-admin-code && node git-api-server.cjs`
2. Open Scripts Management page
3. Try each button and verify:
   - Button shows loading state
   - Status message appears
   - Command completes with appropriate feedback
   - Sync button refreshes the scripts list
