# Supabase Database Schema Audit

## General Observations

### Audit Fields
- **Inconsistent Implementation**: While most tables have `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, and `updated_by` fields, some tables (like `profiles`) are missing these standard audit fields.
- **Nullability Inconsistency**: Some tables have non-nullable audit fields while others allow nulls.
- **Trigger Implementation**: Good use of `handle_audit_timestamps()` and `handle_audit_users()` triggers for maintaining audit fields.

### Data Types
- **Consistent ID Usage**: Good use of UUIDs for primary keys across all tables.
- **JSON Usage**: Several tables use JSONB for flexible data (like `metadata` and `configuration`), which is appropriate but may need schema validation.

## Table-Specific Issues

### 1. `profiles`
- **Missing Audit Fields**: Only has `created_at`, missing `updated_at`, `created_by`, and `updated_by`.
- **Limited User Data**: Consider adding fields for user preferences, display name, and role information.

### 2. `expert_documents`
- **Multiple Nullable Relations**: Both `source_id` and `expert_id` are nullable, which could lead to documents without clear origin.
- **Version Management**: Good use of `previous_version_id`, but consider adding a version number field for easier sequential tracking.

### 3. `audio_processing_configs`
- **Missing Updated By**: Has `updated_at` but missing `updated_by`, breaking the audit field pattern.
- **Configuration Validation**: The JSON `configuration` field has no schema validation.

### 4. `presentation_assets`
- **Unclear Source Reference**: Both `source_id` and `expert_document_id` are nullable, which could lead to assets without clear source references.
- **String Enums**: `asset_type` and `asset_role` are text fields rather than enum types, risking inconsistent values.

### 5. `sources_google`
- **Parent-Child Relationship**: The self-referential relationship (`parent_folder_id` to `drive_id`) is good for hierarchies but may need additional indexes for performance.
- **Metadata Storage**: Consider including a structured metadata field for Google-specific attributes.

### 6. `ai_processing_attempts`
- **Orphaned Records**: `expert_document_id` is nullable, which may make it difficult to trace which document was processed.
- **Model Name Consistency**: No validation on `model_name` to ensure consistency.

## Relationship Issues

### Cascade Behavior Inconsistency
- Some relationships use `CASCADE` for deletions (e.g., `ai_processing_attempts` to `expert_documents`) while others use `NO ACTION`.
- This inconsistency could lead to orphaned records or unexpected preservation of dependent data.

### Missing Indexes
- Complex queries involving multiple joins may benefit from additional indexes, especially on foreign key columns frequently used in WHERE clauses.

## Enum Usage

Your database defines several useful enums:However, several text fields would benefit from enum constraints:
- `asset_type` and `asset_role` in `presentation_assets`
- `model_name` in `ai_processing_attempts`

sql
batch_type: "google_extraction" | "audio_extraction" | "transcription" | "diarization" | "summarization"
processing_stage: "queued" | "downloading" | "extracting" | "processing" | "saving" | "completed" | "failed" | "retrying"
processing_status: "pending" | "queued" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed" | "retrying"



## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Standardize Audit Fields**: Ensure all tables have consistent, non-nullable audit fields.
2. **Add Missing Indexes**: Especially on foreign keys used in frequent queries.
3. **Consistent Deletion Behavior**: Standardize CASCADE vs. NO ACTION policies based on business requirements.

### Schema Improvements
1. **Convert Text to Enums**: For fields like `asset_type`, `asset_role`, and `model_name`.
2. **Add Version Numbers**: Alongside the existing version reference system.
3. **Enhance User Profiles**: Add more comprehensive user data to the profiles table.
4. **Add Consistency Constraints**: Ensure that either `source_id` or `expert_document_id` is non-null in assets.

### Future-Proofing
1. **Schema Validation for JSON**: Consider adding JSON schema validation for configuration fields.
2. **Soft Delete Mechanism**: Add `is_deleted` and `deleted_at` fields to support soft deletions where appropriate.
3. **Partitioning Strategy**: For large tables like `ai_processing_attempts` that will grow rapidly.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure RLS (Row Level Security) policies are in place for all tables containing sensitive data.
- Verify that audit fields are properly maintained by triggers and cannot be manipulated directly by users.
