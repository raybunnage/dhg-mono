# Task Delete Functionality

## Overview
Added the ability to delete tasks from the Claude Tasks UI with a simple, inline confirmation flow.

## Implementation Details

### UI Design
- Added a trash icon button next to the edit button on each task card
- Implemented inline confirmation (replaces buttons with "Delete? Yes/No" when clicked)
- No modal required - keeps the UI clean and simple
- Confirmation prevents accidental deletions

### Technical Implementation

1. **TaskCard Component Updates**:
   - Added `onTaskDelete` prop to handle deletion callbacks
   - Added delete button with trash icon
   - Implemented inline confirmation state
   - Proper event handling to prevent navigation conflicts

2. **TaskService**:
   - Already had `deleteTask` method implemented
   - Uses Supabase's delete operation

3. **TasksPage Updates**:
   - Added `handleTaskDelete` function
   - Removes deleted task from state immediately
   - Passes delete handler to TaskCard components

### How It Works

1. User clicks the trash icon on a task
2. Buttons are replaced with "Delete? Yes/No" confirmation
3. Clicking "Yes" deletes the task and removes it from the UI
4. Clicking "No" cancels and returns to normal button view
5. All operations include proper error handling

### Visual Flow
```
Normal state:        [✏️] [🗑️] [>]
Click delete:        Delete? [Yes] [No]
After delete:        Task removed from list
```

### Safety Features
- Confirmation required before deletion
- Visual feedback during deletion (button shows "...")
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Event propagation properly handled

### Testing
Created test script `test-delete-task.ts` that:
- Creates a test task
- Verifies it exists
- Deletes it
- Confirms deletion was successful

## Usage
Simply click the trash icon on any task you want to delete. Confirm with "Yes" when prompted.

## Notes
- Deletions are permanent (no soft delete currently)
- Related data (tags, files, commits) are cascade deleted
- Consider implementing soft delete in future for recovery options
