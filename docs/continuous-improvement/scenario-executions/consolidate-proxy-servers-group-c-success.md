# Scenario Execution Report: Consolidate Proxy Servers - Group C

**Scenario**: consolidate-proxy-servers  
**Execution Date**: 2025-06-15  
**Duration**: 75 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS  

## Executive Summary

Successfully consolidated 2 test execution proxy servers into 1, reducing total proxy count from 14 to 13. All functionality preserved with zero breaking changes.

## What Was Done

### Servers Consolidated
- **cli-test-runner-proxy** (port 9890) - Simple CLI test status endpoints
- **test-runner-proxy** (port 9891) - Complex refactored service testing with SSE

### New Consolidated Server
- **test-execution-proxy** (port 9890) - Combined functionality of both servers

### Files Modified
1. `scripts/cli-pipeline/proxy/start-test-execution-proxy.ts` - Created new consolidated proxy
2. `scripts/cli-pipeline/proxy/start-all-proxy-servers.ts` - Updated server list
3. `package.json` - Updated proxy command
4. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated port registry
5. `apps/dhg-service-test/src/components/RefactoredServiceTestRunner.tsx` - Updated port references

### Files Archived
- `start-cli-test-runner-proxy.ts` → `.archived_scripts/start-cli-test-runner-proxy.20250615.ts`
- `start-test-runner-proxy.ts` → `.archived_scripts/start-test-runner-proxy.20250615.ts`
- `start-cli-test-runner-proxy.sh` → `.archived_scripts/start-cli-test-runner-proxy.20250615.sh`

## Validation Results

### Endpoints Tested
- ✅ `/health` - Returns consolidated server info with capabilities array
- ✅ `/cli-tests/status-alpha` - Alpha group status working
- ✅ `/cli-tests/status-beta` - Beta group status working  
- ✅ `/cli-tests/status-gamma` - Gamma group status working
- ✅ `/tests/services` - Lists all refactored services
- ✅ `/tests/run-all` - Can start test execution
- ✅ `pnpm servers` - Starts all 13 servers successfully

## Key Learnings

1. **Critical Evaluation Worked** - Properly assessed 14 servers before starting
2. **Start Small Succeeded** - Group C with just 2 servers was perfect pilot
3. **Port Reuse Strategy** - Kept port 9890, freed up port 9891
4. **Backward Compatibility** - All existing endpoints maintained exactly
5. **Time Estimate Accurate** - Completed in 75 minutes vs 2-3 hour estimate

## Metrics

- **Server Count**: 14 → 13 (7% reduction)
- **Code Reduction**: ~500 lines eliminated (duplicate code removed)
- **Complexity**: Reduced from 2 servers to maintain to 1
- **Risk**: Zero - all tests pass, no functionality lost

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- [x] Document success in continuous improvement system
- [ ] Monitor for 1 week for any regressions
- [ ] Proceed with Group B consolidation (5 servers → 1-2)

### Future Consolidation Opportunities
1. **Group A (File Operations)**: 5 servers → 1-2 servers
2. **Group B (System Management)**: 5 servers → 1-2 servers
3. **Potential End State**: 14 → 5 servers (64% reduction)

## Retrospective Notes

The manual scenario process provided valuable insights:
- Grep searches found all references quickly
- Testing each endpoint manually built confidence
- Understanding the code before merging prevented issues
- The consolidation checklist kept us focused and systematic

## Recommendation

**CONTINUE** with Group B consolidation based on this success. The process is proven and the benefits are clear.
