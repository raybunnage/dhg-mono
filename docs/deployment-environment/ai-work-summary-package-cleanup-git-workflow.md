# AI Work Summary: Package.json Cleanup and Git Workflow Pipeline

**Date**: 2025-06-04
**Summary ID**: 9b1d218c-289d-47b5-b871-dec086fa973e

## Overview

This work session focused on two major improvements to the development workflow:
1. Streamlining the root package.json to contain only essential commands
2. Creating a comprehensive Git workflow CLI pipeline

## Package.json Cleanup

### Before
- 69 scripts cluttering the package.json
- Many outdated or rarely used commands
- Duplicated functionality with CLI pipelines
- Difficult to find the actually useful commands

### After
- Reduced to ~15 essential scripts organized in clear categories:
  - **Core Development**: dev, build, test, lint, clean
  - **Server Utilities**: servers (parallel dev), browser
  - **App Shortcuts**: dev:hub, dev:audio, dev:experts, etc.
  - **Utilities**: tree, types
  - **Git Integration**: Single entry point to git workflow pipeline

### Key Improvements
- Removed all database commands (use database-cli.sh instead)
- Removed deployment commands (use deployment pipeline)
- Removed documentation commands (can be moved to docs pipeline)
- Added descriptive comments for each category
- Single `pnpm git` command for all git operations

## Git Workflow CLI Pipeline

### Location
`scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/`

### Features Implemented

#### Git Information Commands
- `git-info` - Comprehensive git repository information
- `git-status` - Current git status
- `worktree-list` - List all git worktrees

#### Branch Management
- `current-branch` - Show current branch
- `list-branches` - List all local and remote branches
- `create-branch <name>` - Create and checkout new branch

#### Testing & Validation
- `run-tests` - Execute test suite
- `check-types` - TypeScript type checking
- `run-lint` - Run linter
- `pre-commit` - Run all pre-commit checks (types, lint, tests)

#### Promotion Workflow
- `promote-to-dev` - Merge current branch to development (worktree-aware)
- `promote-to-main` - Merge development to main (with confirmation)

#### Environment Management
- `copy-env <worktree>` - Copy .env.development from another worktree

#### Utilities
- `prune-branches` - Clean up merged branches

### Technical Implementation
- Shell script wrapper with command tracking integration
- TypeScript implementation for complex commands
- Worktree-aware merge commands (handles checked-out branches)
- Integrated with command registry system
- Full help documentation

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Using pnpm shortcut
pnpm git copy-env dhg-mono
pnpm git check-all
pnpm git promote-to-dev

# Direct usage
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/git-workflow-cli.sh --help
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/git-workflow-cli.sh` - Main CLI script
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/package.json` - Dependencies
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/git-info-detailed.ts` - Enhanced git info
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/populate-registry.sql` - Command registry

### Modified
- `/package.json` - Streamlined to essential commands only

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner root package.json** - Easy to find and use essential commands
2. **Centralized git operations** - All git tasks in one pipeline
3. **Worktree support** - Properly handles multi-worktree development
4. **Improved developer experience** - Simple, memorable commands
5. **Consistent with project standards** - Follows CLI pipeline architecture

## Next Steps
- Consider creating a deployment CLI pipeline to replace deployment scripts
- Add more git workflow commands as needed (cherry-pick, rebase helpers)
- Create documentation pipeline for docs-related commands
- Add git hooks integration to the workflow pipeline
