# AI Work Summary: Health Checks Implementation for All CLI Pipelines

**Date**: 2025-06-04

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive health checks across all CLI pipelines in the monorepo, ensuring each pipeline has a health check command and integrating them all into a master health check system.

## Health Checks Added

### New Health Checks Created
1. **git_workflow** - Custom TypeScript health check for git operations
2. **auth** - Shell-based health check
3. **ai** - Shell-based health check with Claude API key verification
4. **analysis** - Shell-based health check
5. **dev_tasks** - Shell-based health check
6. **documentation** - Shell-based health check with continuous docs check
7. **merge** - Shell-based health check with git verification
8. **mime_types** - Shell-based health check
9. **monitoring** - Shell-based health check
10. **refactor_tracking** - Shell-based health check
11. **tracking** - Shell-based health check
12. **work_summaries** - Shell-based health check
13. **worktree** - Shell-based health check with git verification

### Existing Health Checks Verified
- google_sync
- drive_filter
- document
- experts
- document_types
- media_processing
- presentations
- classify
- prompt_service
- scripts
- database

## Master Health Check Implementation

### Updated Components
1. **master-health-check.ts** - Updated to include all 26 pipelines organized by category
2. **run-all-health-checks.sh** - New shell script that runs all health checks
3. **all-pipelines-cli.sh** - Updated to use the new health check script

### Pipeline Categories
- **Data Integration**: google_sync, drive_filter
- **Content Management**: document, experts, document_types, media_processing, presentations, classify
- **AI Services**: ai, prompt_service, analysis
- **Development Tools**: git, git_workflow, merge, worktree, dev_tasks
- **System Management**: scripts, auth, mime_types, refactor_tracking, tracking, monitoring
- **Documentation**: documentation, work_summaries
- **Infrastructure**: supabase, database

## Health Check Features

Each health check verifies:
- Pipeline directory exists
- Main CLI script is present
- Dependencies are installed (if package.json exists)
- TypeScript files are present
- Database connectivity (for pipelines using database)
- Required tools (git for version control pipelines, Claude API key for AI)
- Logs results to log files

## Current Status

Running `./scripts/cli-pipeline/all_pipelines/all-pipelines-cli.sh master-health-check`:
- Total Pipelines: 25
- Healthy: 20 (80%)
- Failures: 5 (git, experts, merge, worktree, documentation)

The failures are due to:
- Missing core dependencies (git, merge, worktree)
- Missing files or permissions issues
- Some pipelines need their dependencies installed

## Usage

```bash
# Run master health check for all pipelines
./scripts/cli-pipeline/all_pipelines/all-pipelines-cli.sh master-health-check

# Run individual pipeline health checks
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git_workflow/git-workflow-cli.sh health-check
./scripts/cli-pipeline/auth/auth-cli.sh health-check
# ... etc

# Use pnpm shortcut for git workflow
pnpm git health-check
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 5 failing health checks by:
   - Installing missing dependencies
   - Creating missing core files
   - Fixing permission issues
2. Add more detailed health checks for complex pipelines
3. Consider adding performance metrics to health checks
4. Add health check monitoring/alerting for CI/CD
