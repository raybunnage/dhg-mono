# Server Health Endpoints Fix

## Problem
Servers were showing as unhealthy because they didn't have `/health` endpoints implemented.

## Solution
Added `/health` endpoints to all servers that return a JSON response with:
- `status: 'healthy'`
- `service: '<service-name>'`
- `port: <port-number>`
- `timestamp: new Date().toISOString()`

## Servers Updated

1. **Markdown Server** (port 3001) - `scripts/cli-pipeline/viewers/simple-md-server.js`
2. **Script Server** (port 3002) - `scripts/cli-pipeline/viewers/simple-script-server.js`
3. **Docs Archive Server** (port 3003) - `scripts/cli-pipeline/viewers/docs-archive-server.js`
4. **Git Server** (port 3005) - `apps/dhg-admin-code/git-server.cjs`
5. **Continuous Docs Server** (port 3008) - `apps/dhg-admin-code/continuous-docs-server.cjs`
6. **Git API Server** (port 3009) - `apps/dhg-admin-code/git-api-server.cjs`
7. **Audio Proxy Server** (port 3006) - `apps/dhg-audio/server-enhanced.js`
   - Also fixed the missing `dist` directory issue
   - Health endpoint includes additional info about Google Drive and Supabase connectivity

## Testing

After restarting servers, run:
```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/servers/servers-cli.sh health
```

All servers should now report as healthy with proper JSON responses.

## Additional Fixes

- **Audio Server**: Fixed the error about missing `dist/index.html` by:
  - Only serving static files if the `dist` directory exists
  - Providing a JSON response for the fallback route instead of trying to serve a non-existent file
