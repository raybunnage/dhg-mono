# AI Work Summary Best Practices

## Overview

The AI Work Summary system tracks all work completed by AI assistants, making it searchable and reviewable through the dhg-admin-config UI.

## Available Methods

### 1. Quick Auto-Summary (Recommended for AI)

The simplest way - AI can run this after completing any significant work:

```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
  "Title of work completed" \
  "Detailed description of what was done and why" \
  "command1,command2" \
  "tag1,tag2"
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
  "Fixed batch processing in process-new-files-enhanced" \
  "The command was creating 673 duplicate records instead of 7. Fixed by implementing batch processing for Supabase IN queries, processing IDs in groups of 100 to avoid query limits." \
  "process-new-files-enhanced" \
  "bug_fix,batch_processing,google_sync"
```

### 2. Detailed Manual Summary

For more control over all fields:

```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh add \
  --title "Title" \
  --content "Full description" \
  --commands "cmd1,cmd2,cmd3" \
  --tags "tag1,tag2,tag3" \
  --category "bug_fix|feature|refactoring|documentation"
```

### 3. JSON Format (For Complex Summaries)

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/auto-summary.ts --json '{
  "title": "Created comprehensive tracking system",
  "content": "Built database tables, UI, and CLI tools...",
  "commands": ["database-cli", "work-summaries-cli"],
  "tags": ["new_feature", "tracking", "ui"],
  "category": "feature",
  "metadata": {
    "tables_created": ["ai_work_summaries", "command_refactor_tracking"],
    "files_modified": 15
  }
}'
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **When to Add Summaries**
- After completing any significant task
- After fixing bugs
- After creating new features
- After refactoring code
- After updating documentation

### 2. **What Makes a Good Summary**

**Title**: Clear and specific
- ✅ "Fixed batch processing issue in process-new-files-enhanced"
- ❌ "Fixed a bug"

**Content**: Include:
- What was the problem/requirement
- What was done to solve it
- Any important implementation details
- Impact or results

**Commands**: List specific commands worked on
- Use actual command names from CLI tools
- Include multiple if the work touched several

**Tags**: Help with searchability
- Common tags: bug_fix, new_feature, refactoring, database, cli, ui, authentication, google_sync
- Auto-detection will add relevant tags if not specified

**Category**: Choose one:
- `bug_fix` - Fixed existing functionality
- `feature` - Added new functionality
- `refactoring` - Improved code structure
- `documentation` - Updated docs/comments

### 3. **AI Assistant Instructions**

Add this to Claude's instructions or context:

```
After completing any significant work, create a work summary using:

./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
  "Clear title describing what was done" \
  "Detailed description including problem, solution, and impact" \
  "command1,command2" \
  "relevant,tags"

This helps track work history and makes solutions searchable.
```

### 4. **Viewing Summaries**

1. Go to dhg-admin-config: `cd apps/dhg-admin-config && pnpm dev`
2. Login as admin
3. Click "Work Summaries" in the header
4. Use search and filters to find specific work

### 5. **Import Historical Summaries**

To import summaries from claude_code_prompts.txt:

```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh import
```

## Examples of Good Summaries

### Bug Fix Example
```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
  "Fixed orphaned main_video_id references in google_sources" \
  "Folders had main_video_id pointing to deleted videos. Created refresh-main-video-id command that finds MP4 files and updates all items in folder hierarchy. Fixed 2 folders: Raison and Busse presentations." \
  "refresh-main-video-id,assign-main-video-id" \
  "bug_fix,video_management,google_sync"
```

### Feature Example
```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
  "Created AI Work Summary Tracking System" \
  "Built comprehensive system to track AI work: database table with full-text search, React UI in dhg-admin-config with filtering/search, CLI commands for adding summaries. Enables searchable history of all AI assistant work." \
  "database-cli,work-summaries-cli" \
  "new_feature,tracking_system,ui,database"
```

### Refactoring Example
```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
  "Refactored google sync commands to use shared services" \
  "Migrated duplicate code from individual commands to shared services. Reduced code duplication by 60%. All commands now use singleton SupabaseClientService and shared file traversal logic." \
  "google-sync-cli,file-service" \
  "refactoring,code_quality,shared_services"
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# After any work, run:
./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto "What I did" "How and why I did it" "commands" "tags"
