# Git Management Implementation Report

**Date**: February 6, 2025  
**Task**: Implement Git CLI Pipeline and Git Management Page

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Git management system consisting of:
1. A new Git CLI pipeline with commands for managing worktrees and merge queues
2. An enhanced Git Management page in dhg-admin-code with UI for visualizing and managing git operations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Git CLI Pipeline (`/scripts/cli-pipeline/git/`)

Created a new CLI pipeline with the following structure:
- `git-cli.sh` - Main CLI entry point with command routing
- `package.json` - Dependencies configuration
- `commands/` - Individual command implementations

#### Implemented Commands:

1. **list-worktrees** - Lists all git worktrees with active task information
2. **worktree-status** - Shows detailed status of all worktrees (clean/dirty, ahead/behind)
3. **merge-queue-list** - Displays branches in merge queue with status
4. **merge-queue-add** - Adds a branch to the merge queue with priority
5. **run-merge-checks** - Runs automated checks on a branch (conflicts, tests, etc.)
6. **health-check** - Verifies git CLI functionality and database connections

#### Key Features:
- Integration with dev_tasks and dev_merge_queue tables
- Command tracking support for usage analytics
- Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly output
- Color-coded status indicators for better visibility

### 2. Git Management Page Updates

Enhanced the existing Git Management page (`/apps/dhg-admin-code/src/pages/GitManagement.tsx`) with:

#### UI Improvements:
- **Refresh Worktrees button** - Reloads worktree and task data
- **Add to Merge Queue button** - Opens modal for adding branches
- **Interactive worktree cards** - Status check and update buttons per worktree
- **Merge queue actions** - Check Status and Start Merge buttons
- **Add to Queue modal** - Form for adding branches with priority and notes

#### Functionality:
- Real-time display of active tasks per worktree
- Color-coded merge status indicators
- Merge checklist visualization
- Tab-based navigation (Worktrees, Merge Queue, Merge History)

### 3. Database Integration

The implementation leverages existing database tables:
- `dev_tasks` - For tracking active tasks in worktrees
- `dev_merge_queue` - For managing merge queue items
- `dev_merge_checklist` - For tracking merge readiness checks

## Usage Examples

### CLI Commands:
```bash
# List all worktrees with task information
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git/git-cli.sh list-worktrees

# Check detailed status of all worktrees
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git/git-cli.sh worktree-status

# View merge queue
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git/git-cli.sh merge-queue-list

# Add current branch to merge queue
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git/git-cli.sh merge-queue-add --priority 1 --notes "Feature complete"

# Run merge checks on a branch
./scripts/cli-pipeline/git/git-cli.sh run-merge-checks --branch feature/my-feature
```

### Web UI:
1. Navigate to `/git` in dhg-admin-code
2. View worktrees with active task counts
3. Monitor merge queue status
4. Run checks and manage merges through button actions

## Architecture Notes

1. **Shared Adapter Pattern**: Uses `createSupabaseAdapter` for cross-environment compatibility
2. **Command Tracking**: Integrated with existing command tracking infrastructure
3. **TypeScript**: All commands written in TypeScript with proper type safety
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full CLI Integration**: Connect UI buttons to actual CLI command execution
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
3. **Advanced Merge Strategies**: Support for different merge strategies and conflict resolution
4. **Worktree Creation UI**: Add ability to create/remove worktrees from the UI
5. **Command Registry**: Register the git pipeline in the command registry for tracking

## Testing

Created `test-git-cli.sh` for testing all implemented commands. The commands successfully:
- Display worktree information
- Show merge queue status
- Run health checks on git and database connectivity
- Handle errors gracefully

## Conclusion

The Git management system provides a solid foundation for managing git operations in a monorepo environment. The combination of CLI tools and web UI offers flexibility for both command-line and visual workflows.
