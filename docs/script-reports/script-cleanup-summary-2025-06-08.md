# Script Cleanup Summary - June 8, 2025

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive script archiving system and completed Phase 1 of script cleanup.

## Implementation Complete

1. **Database Table Created**: `sys_archived_scripts_files`
   - Tracks all archived scripts with metadata
   - Includes archive reason, file size, and restoration capability
   - RLS policies for secure access

2. **CLI Commands Added**:
   - `analyze-script-usage` - Analyzes script usage across the monorepo
   - `archive-scripts` - Archives scripts with database tracking
   - `restore-script` - Restores archived scripts
   - `list-archived` - Lists and queries archived scripts

3. **Gitignore Updated**:
   - Added patterns for archive directories
   - Prevents archived scripts from being committed

## Archiving Results

### Phase 1 Complete: 27 Scripts Archived

**By Category**:
- **Fix Scripts (6 scripts)**: One-time migration and fix scripts
  - `fix-metadata.sh`, `fix-metadata-fields.js`, `fix-metadata copy.sh`
  - `fix-ai-integration.sh`, `migrate-size-field.ts`, `fix-batch-analyze.sh`

- **Deployment Scripts (3 scripts)**: Obsolete deployment tools
  - `deploy-app.sh`, `backup-env-configs.sh`, `setup-environments.sh`

- **From Apps Scripts (18 scripts)**: Extracted from dhg-improve-experts
  - Various migration and utility scripts now in CLI pipelines
  - Includes docs-organization subdirectory scripts

**Total Space Saved**: 79.1 KB

### Archive Locations

All archived scripts are stored in:
- `scripts/.archived_root_scripts/fix-scripts-phase1-20250608/`
- `scripts/.archived_root_scripts/fix-scripts-phase2-20250608/`
- `scripts/.archived_root_scripts/deployment-scripts-20250608/`
- `scripts/.archived_root_scripts/from-apps-scripts-20250608/`

## Next Steps

### Remaining Scripts to Review

1. **Python Scripts** (`scripts/python/`):
   - Audio processing tools (whisper, modal)
   - May still be actively used
   - Need usage analysis

2. **App Management** (`scripts/app-management/`):
   - Lovable app management tools
   - Check if still needed

3. **Root Scripts** (`scripts/root/`):
   - Various utility scripts
   - Need individual assessment

4. **Remaining Fix Scripts**:
   - `fix-permissions.sh`
   - `supabase-connect.js`

### Recommendations

1. **Adjust Analysis Criteria**: Current analysis uses file modification dates which show all scripts as "active". Consider:
   - Git history analysis
   - Import/require references
   - Command tracking data

2. **Continue Phased Approach**:
   - Phase 2: Python scripts (if obsolete)
   - Phase 3: Root utility scripts
   - Phase 4: App-specific scripts

3. **Monitor Restoration Requests**: Track if any archived scripts need to be restored

## Commands for Management

```bash
# List all archived scripts
./scripts/cli-pipeline/deprecation/deprecation-cli.sh list-archived

# Restore a specific script
./scripts/cli-pipeline/deprecation/deprecation-cli.sh restore-script --path "scripts/fix/fix-metadata.sh"

# View archive summary
./scripts/cli-pipeline/deprecation/deprecation-cli.sh list-archived --summary
```

## Safety Features Implemented

1. **Database Tracking**: All archives tracked in `sys_archived_scripts_files`
2. **Easy Restoration**: Single command to restore any archived script
3. **Archive Preservation**: Original files kept with date stamps
4. **Audit Trail**: Archive reasons and dates recorded

The script cleanup system is now fully operational and ready for continued use.
