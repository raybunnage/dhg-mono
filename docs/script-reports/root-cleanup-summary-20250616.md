# Root Directory Cleanup Summary Report

**Date**: June 16, 2025  
**Task**: Clean up stray files from monorepo root directory per CLAUDE.md guidelines

## Executive Summary

Successfully cleaned up 41 stray files from the root directory that violated the monorepo organization principles. All files have been either:
1. **Moved** to their proper location (21 files)
2. **Archived** with appropriate dates (20 files)

## Key Actions Taken

### 1. Active Scripts Relocated (8 files)
- Testing utilities moved to `scripts/cli-pipeline/refactoring/`
- Proxy server scripts moved to `scripts/cli-pipeline/proxy/`
- Utility scripts moved to `scripts/cli-pipeline/utilities/`

### 2. Documentation Organized (9 files)
- Refactoring guides ‚Üí `docs/refactoring/`
- Solution guides ‚Üí `docs/solution-guides/`
- Workflow documentation ‚Üí `docs/deployment-environment/`

### 3. Temporary Scripts Archived (16 files)
- One-time fix scripts from refactoring phases
- Worktree setup scripts (alpha/beta/gamma phases complete)
- Merge helper scripts (no longer needed)

### 4. Other Files Cleaned (4 files)
- SQL files ‚Üí `supabase/migrations/archive/`
- JSON reports ‚Üí `docs/script-reports/`
- Backup files ‚Üí `.archived_scripts/`

## Impact Analysis

### ‚úÖ Compliance with CLAUDE.md
- **BEFORE**: 41 files violating root directory restriction
- **AFTER**: 0 stray files in root (only proper config files remain)

### üìÅ Organization Improvements
- Scripts now properly organized by domain
- Documentation categorized by type
- Clear distinction between active and archived content

### üîç Traceability
- All archived files include date stamp (20250616)
- Clear reasons documented for each move/archive decision
- Detailed report for future reference

## File Categories Summary

| Category | Moved | Archived | Total |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Scripts (.sh/.ts) | 8 | 16 | 24 |
| Documentation (.md) | 9 | 2 | 11 |
| SQL Files | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| Other Files | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| **Total** | **21** | **20** | **41** |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Temporary scripts** should be placed in appropriate CLI pipeline folders even during development
2. **One-time fixes** should be archived immediately after use
3. **Documentation** should go directly to docs/ folders, not root
4. **Worktree/merge scripts** are temporary by nature and should be in utilities with clear archival plan

## Recommendations

1. **Add pre-commit hook** to prevent new files in root directory
2. **Update developer guidelines** to emphasize proper file placement
3. **Regular cleanup** - run cleanup check monthly
4. **Template locations** - provide clear examples of where each file type belongs

## Cleanup Script Location

The cleanup script used for this operation is available at:
```
scripts/cli-pipeline/utilities/cleanup-root-strays.ts
```

It can be run again in the future if needed to maintain root directory cleanliness.

## Conclusion

The monorepo root directory is now clean and compliant with CLAUDE.md guidelines. All files have been properly organized according to their purpose and lifecycle stage. This cleanup improves project maintainability and sets a clear standard for future development.
