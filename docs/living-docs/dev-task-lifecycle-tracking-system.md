# Dev Task Lifecycle Tracking System
**Living Document - Last Updated: 2025-06-12**

## Overview

The Dev Task Lifecycle Tracking System provides comprehensive visibility into the complete lifecycle of development tasks, from creation through completion. It integrates work summaries, validation tracking, test results, and follow-up task management into a unified system.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema

The system is built on several interconnected tables:

1. **Core Tables**:
   - `dev_tasks` - Enhanced with tracking columns (work_summary_count, last_work_summary_at, etc.)
   - `ai_work_summaries` - Enhanced with dev_task_id and validation fields
   - `work_summary_todos` - Todo items for each work summary
   - `work_summary_validations` - Validation results and issues
   - `test_results` - Test execution results and coverage
   - `dev_follow_up_tasks` - Links between original and follow-up tasks
   - `task_todo_templates` - Auto-generate todos based on task type

2. **Views**:
   - `work_summary_tracking_view` - Comprehensive tracking dashboard view
   - `dev_tasks_with_follow_ups_view` - Tasks with their follow-up tasks
   - `ai_work_summaries_with_follow_ups_view` - Summaries with follow-ups

### Service Architecture

The tracking functionality is implemented in:
- **DevTaskService** (`packages/shared/services/dev-task-service/`)
  - Main service with lifecycle tracking methods
  - `lifecycle` property provides all tracking functionality
- **LifecycleTrackingMixin** (`lifecycle-tracking.ts`)
  - Encapsulates all lifecycle tracking methods
  - Handles work summaries, todos, validations, and tests

## Key Features

### 1. Work Summary Integration

Work summaries can be linked to dev tasks with automatic todo generation:

```typescript
// Create a work summary linked to a task
const summaryId = await taskService.lifecycle.createWorkSummaryWithTaskLink({
  title: 'Implemented authentication feature',
  content: 'Added OAuth2 support with Google and GitHub providers',
  taskId: 'task-uuid',
  worktree: 'feature/auth',
  gitCommit: 'abc123',
  category: 'feature'
});
```

### 2. Todo Management

Todos are automatically created from templates based on task type:

- **Feature tasks**: Requirements review, unit tests, documentation, code review
- **Bugfix tasks**: Reproduce bug, write test, fix bug, verify fix
- **Refactor tasks**: Ensure tests pass, refactor incrementally, run tests, update docs

```typescript
// Get todos for a work summary
const todos = await taskService.lifecycle.getWorkSummaryTodos(summaryId);

// Toggle todo completion
await taskService.lifecycle.toggleTodo(todoId);

// Add custom todo
await taskService.lifecycle.addTodo(summaryId, 'Review performance impact', 'high');
```

### 3. Validation Tracking

Track validation results with detailed issue tracking:

```typescript
// Record validation results
await taskService.lifecycle.createValidation({
  workSummaryId: summaryId,
  devTaskId: taskId,
  status: 'issues_found',
  summary: 'Found 3 linting errors',
  issues: [
    { file: 'auth.ts', line: 45, message: 'Unused variable' },
    { file: 'auth.ts', line: 67, message: 'Missing type annotation' }
  ]
});
```

### 4. Test Result Tracking

Comprehensive test result recording with coverage:

```typescript
// Record test results
await taskService.lifecycle.recordTestResults({
  devTaskId: taskId,
  workSummaryId: summaryId,
  testSuiteName: 'Unit Tests',
  passed: 45,
  failed: 5,
  skipped: 2,
  coverage: 87.5,
  reportUrl: 'https://ci.example.com/reports/123'
});
```

### 5. Follow-up Task Management

Create and track follow-up tasks:

```typescript
// Create a follow-up task
const followUpId = await taskService.lifecycle.createFollowUpTask({
  parentTaskId: taskId,
  title: 'Add integration tests for OAuth',
  followUpType: 'testing',
  priority: 'high',
  description: 'Need to add e2e tests for the new OAuth flow'
});
```

### 6. Comprehensive Tracking View

The `work_summary_tracking_view` provides:
- Task and submission information
- Validation status and issue counts
- Test results and coverage
- Todo progress
- Follow-up task status
- Action indicators (needs_action flag)

## CLI Commands

### Create Work Summary
```bash
./dev-tasks-cli.sh create-summary <task-id> \
  --title "Implemented feature X" \
  --content "Detailed description..." \
  --worktree feature-branch \
  --commit abc123
```

### Track Validation
```bash
./dev-tasks-cli.sh track-validation <task-id> \
  --status passed \
  --summary "All validation checks passed"

# With issues
./dev-tasks-cli.sh track-validation <task-id> \
  --status issues_found \
  --summary "Found linting errors" \
  --issues "Missing semicolon,Unused import"
```

### Track Test Results
```bash
./dev-tasks-cli.sh track-tests <task-id> \
  --passed 45 \
  --failed 5 \
  --skipped 2 \
  --coverage 87.5 \
  --suite "Unit Tests" \
  --report-url "https://ci.example.com/reports/123"
```

### Show Tracking Information
```bash
./dev-tasks-cli.sh show-tracking <task-id>
```

## Visual Indicators

The system uses visual indicators for quick status assessment:

- **Submission Status**:
  - ‚ö™ Gray: Not submitted
  - üü° Yellow: In progress
  - üü¢ Green: Completed
  - üî¥ Red: Failed

- **Validation Status**:
  - ‚úÖ Passed
  - ‚ùå Failed
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues found

- **Test Status**:
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing
  - ‚ùå Tests failing
  - üìä Coverage percentage

- **Action Required**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è When tests fail, validation has issues, or follow-ups are incomplete

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Task Lifecycle

1. **Task Creation**: Developer creates a task
2. **Development**: Code is written and commits are made
3. **Work Summary**: Summary created with automatic todos
4. **Validation**: Code is validated (linting, type checking)
5. **Testing**: Tests are run and results recorded
6. **Follow-ups**: Any necessary follow-up tasks are created
7. **Completion**: Task marked complete when all checks pass

### Automated Tracking Points

- **On commit**: Git commit info is tracked
- **On work summary creation**: Todos are auto-generated
- **On validation run**: Results are recorded
- **On test execution**: Coverage and results are stored
- **On follow-up creation**: Links are established

## Database Functions

### create_work_summary_with_task_link
Creates a work summary linked to a task with automatic todo generation based on task type.

### create_follow_up_task
Creates a follow-up task linked to a parent task with proper relationship tracking.

### get_work_summary_tracking
Retrieves comprehensive tracking information for a work summary.

### get_follow_ups
Gets all follow-up tasks for a given task or work summary.

## Best Practices

1. **Always link work summaries to tasks** when they're related
2. **Track validation and test results** immediately after execution
3. **Use appropriate follow-up types**: validation, testing, documentation, bug_fix, enhancement
4. **Complete todos** as work progresses to maintain accurate status
5. **Monitor the needs_action flag** to identify tasks requiring attention

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing todos after work summary creation**
   - Check if task_todo_templates has entries for the task type
   - Verify the category parameter matches template task types

2. **Validation not showing in tracking view**
   - Ensure validation is linked to the correct work_summary_id
   - Check that the validation_status is valid

3. **Test results not appearing**
   - Verify both dev_task_id and/or work_summary_id are provided
   - Check that counts are numeric values

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Automated validation triggers on commits
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD for automatic test result recording
- [ ] Predictive analytics for task completion time
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications for action items
- [ ] Dashboard UI for visual tracking

## Migration History
