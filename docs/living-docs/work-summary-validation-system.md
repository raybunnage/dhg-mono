## Metadata
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-11
- **Next Review**: 2025-06-12
- **Status**: Active
- **Priority**: High
- **Category**: Development
- **Related Tasks**: #5dd0c3ef-32e8-4f21-941e-387718daa510

## Executive Summary
A validation workflow system that creates follow-up tasks from work summaries to verify implementations, write tests, update registries, and complete the development lifecycle with proper tracking and documentation.

## Phase 1: Basic Validation Task Creation

### Summary
Implement UI button on work summaries to create validation tasks with a predefined checklist, linking work summaries to their validation tasks for tracking implementation quality.

### Value Proposition
**Potential Gains:**
- Systematic validation of all implemented features
- Automated test creation reminders
- Complete development lifecycle tracking
- Better quality assurance through structured validation

**Implementation Effort:**
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Dependencies**: Work summaries UI, dev tasks system

**Risks & Challenges:**
- Users might skip validation steps
- May create task overload if not managed well
- Need to ensure validation tasks are actually completed

### Priority Score: High
**Justification**: High value for quality assurance with minimal implementation effort. Ensures all work is properly validated and tested.

### Success Criteria
- [x] Created WorkSummaryValidationModal component
- [x] Added "Validate" button to work summaries without validation
- [x] Implemented 8-point validation checklist
- [x] Created database migration for tracking relationships
- [x] Linked validation tasks to parent work summaries
- [ ] Deploy and test with real work summaries

## Current State
- Created `WorkSummaryValidationModal` with comprehensive validation checklist:
  1. Validate successful implementation
  2. Write or enhance tests
  3. Evaluate test results
  4. Update tracking statuses
  5. Update registries and definitions
  6. Complete task lifecycle
  7. Database schema updates
  8. Update living documentation
- Added "Validate" button to work summaries UI
- Created database view `dev_validation_tasks_view` for tracking
- Added function `get_work_summary_validation_status()` for status checks
- Validation tasks are created with parent work summary reference

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Automated Validation Workflows
- **Summary**: Add automated checks and test running capabilities
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 1 completion, test infrastructure
- **Estimated Value**: High

### Phase 3: Validation Dashboard
- **Summary**: Create dashboard showing validation coverage and status
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 2 completion, sufficient validation data
- **Estimated Value**: Medium

### Phase 4: Sub-task Hierarchies
- **Summary**: Implement parent-child task relationships for complex validations
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 3 completion, database schema updates
- **Estimated Value**: Medium

## Implementation Details

### UI Components
- **WorkSummaryValidationModal**: Modal dialog with validation checklist
- **Validate Button**: Appears on work summaries without existing validation
- **Checklist Items**: 8 predefined validation steps (5 required, 3 optional)

### Database Structure
- Uses existing `metadata` JSON fields in both tables
- `ai_work_summaries.metadata`: Stores `validation_task_id`, `validation_created_at`
- `dev_tasks.metadata`: Stores `parent_work_summary_id`, `validation_checklist`, `is_validation_task`
- Created indexes for efficient lookups

### Workflow
1. User clicks "Validate" on a work summary
2. Modal shows 8-point validation checklist
3. User selects relevant validation items (must select all required)
4. System creates dev_task with validation details
5. Links task back to work summary via metadata
6. User navigated to new validation task

## Best Practices
- Always select all applicable validation items
- Complete validation tasks promptly after work
- Document validation results in task comments
- Update living docs with validation outcomes
- Close validation tasks when all items complete

## Notes & Considerations
- Consider adding validation templates for different work types
- May want to add validation metrics/reporting in future
- Could integrate with automated testing pipelines
- Validation tasks help ensure nothing falls through cracks
- Creates audit trail of quality assurance activities
