## What is a Continuously Updated Document?

A continuously updated document is a **living document** that:
- Serves as the single source of truth for a specific area
- Gets regularly reviewed and updated (every 14-30 days)
- Tracks its own update history and next review date
- Links to archived documentation for historical context
- Evolves with the project rather than becoming stale

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. **Be Concise but Complete**

- Add new learnings as you discover them
- Update status and progress regularly
- Mark completed items promptly

### 3. **Maintain Living Nature**
- Remove outdated information (archive it if valuable)
- Update examples to reflect current code
- Revise priorities based on project needs
- Keep next steps actionable and current

### 4. **Use Consistent Formatting**
- **Bold** for emphasis and important terms
- `Code formatting` for commands, file names, and code
- ‚úÖ ‚ùå for do/don't patterns
- üìã üöß ‚úÖ for status indicators
- Checkboxes for trackable tasks

### 5. **Link Appropriately**
- Reference specific files with full paths
- Link to other living documents
- Note archive IDs for historical context
- Include line numbers for code references when helpful

## Review Checklist

When reviewing a continuously updated document:

- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date
- [ ] Set appropriate "Next Review" date
- [ ] Update status if changed
- [ ] Review and update "Current Priority"
- [ ] Check off completed tasks
- [ ] Add new tasks/phases as needed
- [ ] Update "Lessons Learned" with new insights
- [ ] Revise "Next Steps" to reflect current priorities
- [ ] Archive any outdated sections
- [ ] Ensure all links and references are current
- [ ] Add any new related documentation

## Database Integration

Each continuously updated document should have an entry in `doc_continuous_monitoring`:

```sql
-- Example registration
INSERT INTO doc_continuous_monitoring (
    file_path,
    title,
    area,
    description,
    review_frequency_days,
    priority,
    next_review_date
) VALUES (
    '/docs/continuously-updated/your-doc.md',
    'Your Document Title',
    'area-name', -- e.g., 'cli-pipeline', 'shared-services', 'deployment'
    'Brief description of what this covers',
    14, -- Review every 14 days for high-priority
    'high',
    CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '14 days'
);
```

## Examples of Good Continuously Updated Documents

1. **CLI Pipeline Documentation** (`cli-pipelines-documentation.md`)
   - Clear phase-based progress tracking
   - Specific commands and examples
   - Regular updates on new pipelines

2. **Code Continuous Monitoring** (`code-continuous-monitoring.md`)
   - Strong vision statement
   - Detailed implementation status
   - Clear success metrics

3. **Apps Documentation** (`apps-documentation.md`)
   - Comprehensive overview of all apps
   - Consistent format for each entry
   - Quick reference information

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Information Hoarding**
   - ‚ùå Keeping all historical information in the document
   - ‚úÖ Archive old content and reference it

2. **Vague Updates**
   - ‚ùå "Updated various things"
   - ‚úÖ "Added error handling to google-sync pipeline, fixed auth bug #123"

3. **Stale Priorities**
   - ‚ùå Leaving completed items as "current priority"
   - ‚úÖ Regularly updating focus areas

4. **Missing Context**
   - ‚ùå Technical details without explanation
   - ‚úÖ Brief context for why decisions were made

5. **Forgetting Reviews**
   - ‚ùå Letting review dates pass
   - ‚úÖ Setting calendar reminders or using the monitoring system

## Quick Start for New Document

1. Copy this template structure
2. Fill in all required sections
3. Register in the database:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cli-pipeline/docs/docs-cli.sh register \
     --path /docs/continuously-updated/your-doc.md \
     --area your-area \
     --frequency 14
   ```
4. Set a calendar reminder for the first review
5. Start with minimal content and grow organically
