# Phase 2: DatabaseMetadataService Extraction Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created DatabaseMetadataService
- **Location**: `packages/shared/services/database-metadata-service/`
- **Files Created**:
  - `types.ts` - Comprehensive types for database metadata
  - `database-metadata-service.ts` - Full service implementation
  - `index.ts` - Clean exports

### 2. Service Features
- **Table Management**:
  - Get all tables with metadata (row count, size, creation date)
  - Filter tables by various criteria
  - Get table details including columns, indexes, foreign keys
  
- **View Management**:
  - List all views with suggested prefixes
  - Get view definitions and columns
  
- **Database Statistics**:
  - Total tables, views, records
  - Storage usage
  - Table prefixes and categorization
  
- **Export Capabilities**:
  - Export table list as CSV
  - Export SQL schema for tables/views

### 3. Updated DatabasePage.tsx
- Replaced all direct Supabase RPC calls with DatabaseMetadataService
- Fixed async `getPrefixInfo` issue by using React state
- Maintained full backward compatibility
- No functionality changes - just cleaner architecture

## Benefits
1. **Reusability**: Database introspection is now available to any app
2. **Maintainability**: Database logic centralized in one service
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive types for all database metadata
4. **Browser Compatible**: Uses singleton pattern with dependency injection

## Testing Notes
The service was integrated into DatabasePage.tsx which is actively used in dhg-admin-code. The page continues to function exactly as before, confirming the extraction was successful.
