## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Service Integration Issues**

### Critical Issues
- [ ] **Issue #001: Bash declare -g compatibility**
  - **Component**: CLIPipelineBase.sh
  - **Problem**: `declare -g` not supported in older bash versions (macOS default)
  - **Impact**: Base class fails to load on macOS
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Removed -g flag, using standard variable declarations
  - **Resolution Date**: 2025-06-14
  - **Notes**: Tested on macOS, now works correctly

### Service-Specific Issues
- [ ] **DatabaseService Integration** (Pending Testing)
  - **Component**: SimpleCLIPipeline.sh execute_db_query function
  - **Problem**: Need to test TypeScript import in bash context
  - **Impact**: Database operations may fail
  - **Status**: üîÑ **PENDING** - Requires testing with actual DatabaseService

- [ ] **FileSystemService Integration** (Pending Testing)
  - **Component**: File operation utilities
  - **Problem**: Need to verify cross-platform compatibility
  - **Impact**: File operations may have permission issues
  - **Status**: üîÑ **PENDING** - Requires testing on different platforms

## üîß **Framework Issues**

### Command Discovery
- [ ] **Issue #002: Command auto-discovery limitation**
  - **Component**: CLIPipelineBase.sh discover_commands function
  - **Problem**: Only finds functions with exact "command_" prefix, doesn't show descriptions
  - **Impact**: Help system doesn't show all available commands with descriptions
  - **Status**: üîÑ **OPEN** - Enhancement needed
  - **Proposed Solution**: Improve regex pattern and add description extraction

### Performance
- [ ] **Issue #003: Service loading overhead**
  - **Component**: load_service function
  - **Problem**: Multiple service checks may slow down command execution
  - **Impact**: CLI performance degradation
  - **Status**: üîÑ **OPEN** - Monitoring needed
  - **Proposed Solution**: Implement service caching

## üéØ **Resolution Strategy**

### Immediate Actions (During Migration)
1. **Document all issues** as they're discovered
2. **Use fallback implementations** to maintain functionality
3. **Note missing services** for consolidated service creation request
4. **Test critical paths** to ensure no regression

### Batch Resolution (After Migration)
1. **Create missing services** based on collected requirements
2. **Fix integration issues** with proper testing
3. **Optimize performance** based on usage patterns
4. **Enhance framework** based on discovered limitations

### Service Creation Priority
1. **MediaProcessorService** - Critical for media workflows
2. **ClassificationService** - Core for content processing
3. **EmailService** - Important for automation
4. **BackupService** - Essential for data safety
5. **ConfigurationService** - System-wide consistency
6. **ValidationService** - Quality assurance
7. **ReportingService** - Enhanced capabilities
8. **SchedulerService** - Advanced automation
