# CLI Service Integration Issues

## Missing Services During CLI Pipeline Refactoring

This document tracks services that are referenced by CLI pipelines but are not yet properly implemented as refactored shared services.

### DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
**Pipeline**: `deployment-cli.sh`
**Issue**: DeploymentService ES module import issues
**Current Status**: Refactored to singleton pattern but ES module imports failing
**Impact**: HIGH - Production deployment operations
**Action Required**: Fix ES module directory imports

**Details**:
- The deployment CLI references `deploymentService` from '../../../packages/shared/services/deployment-service'
- DeploymentService has been refactored to proper singleton pattern
- ES module imports fail with "ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT" error
- Fallback functionality working correctly for all commands
- TypeScript CLI implementation requires ES module fix

**Refactoring Completed**:
- ✅ Created deployment-service-refactored/ with proper structure
- ✅ Implemented singleton pattern (not extending SingletonService due to compatibility)
- ✅ Created types.ts with all interfaces
- ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- ✅ Created test suite structure
- ✅ Added backward compatibility exports
- ✅ Created MIGRATION.md guide

**Remaining Issue**:
- ❌ ES module directory imports not working with ts-node
- ✅ Workaround: Fallback implementations provide basic functionality

### Resolution Status
- ✅ **DeploymentService**: Refactored to singleton pattern
- ❌ **ES Module Imports**: Directory imports failing in TypeScript CLI

### Notes
All Group ALPHA pipelines have been successfully refactored. The DeploymentService has been properly refactored but ES module import issues prevent the TypeScript CLI from loading. The bash fallback implementations provide sufficient functionality for basic operations.
