# CLI Service Integration Issues

## Missing Services During CLI Pipeline Refactoring

This document tracks services that are referenced by CLI pipelines but are not yet properly implemented as refactored shared services.

### DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
**Pipeline**: `deployment-cli.sh`
**Issue**: DeploymentService referenced but needs proper refactoring
**Current Status**: Basic deployment-service.ts exists but not fully integrated
**Impact**: HIGH - Production deployment operations
**Action Required**: Refactor deployment-service.ts to follow shared service patterns

**Details**:
- The deployment CLI references `deploymentService` from '../../../packages/shared/services/deployment-service'
- Current implementation exists but causes module resolution errors
- Needs refactoring to SingletonService pattern with proper dependency injection
- Critical for production deployment safety and validation workflows

### Resolution Status
- ‚ùå **DeploymentService**: Not yet refactored to shared service patterns

### Notes
All other Group ALPHA pipelines have been successfully refactored and tested. The DeploymentService is the only remaining service integration issue for Group ALPHA completion.
