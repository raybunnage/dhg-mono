*Continuously Updated Document - Created: 2025-06-09*

## Current Status

**Implementation Phase**: Strategy Development and Database Setup
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-09
**Next Review**: 2025-06-16

## Document Purpose

This living document outlines a comprehensive strategy for managing and archiving the 700+ documents in the DHG monorepo. The strategy leverages the continuously-updated documents system to create manageable, living documentation while systematically archiving outdated materials.

## Executive Summary

The Document Archiving Strategy addresses the challenge of managing an overwhelming volume of documentation (700+ files) by implementing a three-tier system: **Living Documents** (continuously-updated), **Active Documents** (current but not living), and **Archived Documents** (historical reference). This approach reduces cognitive load while preserving institutional knowledge.

## Current Situation Analysis

### Document Volume Breakdown
- **Technical Specs**: ~180 documents in `/docs/technical-specs/`
- **Solution Guides**: ~45 documents in `/docs/solution-guides/`
- **Work Summaries**: ~85 documents in `/docs/work-summaries/`
- **Script Reports**: ~65 documents in `/docs/script-reports/`
- **Code Documentation**: ~120 documents in `/docs/code-documentation/`
- **CLI Pipelines**: ~90 documents in `/docs/cli-pipeline/`
- **Continuously Updated**: ~17 living documents (recently created)
- **Other Categories**: ~100+ miscellaneous documents

### Key Problems
1. **Information Overload**: Too many documents to effectively navigate
2. **Redundancy**: Multiple documents covering similar topics
3. **Staleness**: Many documents are outdated but still visible
4. **Discovery Issues**: Difficulty finding current, relevant information
5. **Maintenance Burden**: Impossible to keep all documents current

## Phase-Based Archival Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Living Document Expansion (Weeks 1-2)
**Objective**: Create archival infrastructure and expand living document coverage

#### Key Tasks:

1. **Create Document Archiving System**
   ```sql
   -- Document archiving tracking table
   CREATE TABLE doc_archives (
     archive_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     original_path TEXT NOT NULL,
     archived_path TEXT NOT NULL,
     archive_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
     archived_by TEXT,
     archived_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     replacement_doc_path TEXT, -- Link to living document that replaces this
     restoration_notes TEXT,
     metadata JSONB
   );
   
   -- Archive validation and tracking
   CREATE TABLE doc_archive_validation (
     validation_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     archive_id UUID REFERENCES doc_archives(archive_id),
     validation_status TEXT CHECK (validation_status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
     validator TEXT,
     validation_notes TEXT,
     validated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

   ├── .archives/
   │   ├── 2024/
   │   │   ├── technical-specs/
   │   │   ├── solution-guides/
   │   │   ├── work-summaries/
   │   │   └── script-reports/
   │   ├── 2025/
   │   │   ├── Q1/
   │   │   ├── Q2/
   │   │   └── current-quarter/
   │   └── by-category/
   │       ├── database/
   │       ├── authentication/
   │       ├── deployment/
   │       └── testing/
   ```

2. **Automated Archival Process**
   ```typescript
   // Document archival service
   class DocumentArchivalService {
     async archiveDocument(docPath: string, reason: string, replacementPath?: string) {
       // 1. Validate document exists
       // 2. Create archive entry in database
       // 3. Move document to appropriate archive folder
       // 4. Update any references to point to replacement
       // 5. Create redirect mapping
     }
     
     async batchArchive(documents: ArchivalCandidate[]) {
       // Process multiple documents with validation
     }
     
     async validateArchival(archiveId: string, approved: boolean, notes: string) {
       // Approval workflow for archival decisions
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Archive Management CLI**
   ```bash
   # New CLI commands for document management
   ./scripts/cli-pipeline/documentation/docs-cli.sh archive <doc-path> --reason "superseded by living doc"
   ./scripts/cli-pipeline/documentation/docs-cli.sh list-archives --category technical-specs
   ./scripts/cli-pipeline/documentation/docs-cli.sh restore <archive-id>

### Monitoring and Validation
```typescript
// Archive monitoring service
class ArchiveMonitoringService {
  // Track what documents are being accessed
  async trackDocumentAccess(docPath: string, userId: string) {}
  
  // Identify unused documents
  async findUnusedDocuments(daysThreshold: number) {}
  
  // Validate archive decisions
  async validateArchiveDecisions() {}
  
  // Generate archive statistics
  async generateArchiveReport() {}
}
```
