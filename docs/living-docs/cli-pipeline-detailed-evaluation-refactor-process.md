# CLI Pipeline Detailed Evaluation & Refactor Process

## 🎯 **Purpose**
Comprehensive step-by-step guide for parallel worktree groups to consistently evaluate, analyze, and refactor CLI pipelines while maintaining quality and coordination.

**Target Audience**: Worktree group teams (Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
**Prerequisites**: Base class framework, worktree setup, group assignment document

---

## 📋 **Phase 1: Setup & Preparation (30 minutes per group)**

### **1.1 Worktree Environment Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to your assigned worktree
cd ../dhg-mono-[alpha|beta|gamma]-cli-refactor

# Verify base classes are available
ls scripts/cli-pipeline/base-classes/
# Should show: CLIPipelineBase.sh, SimpleCLIPipeline.sh, ServiceCLIPipeline.sh, multi-worktree-framework.sh

# Load the coordination framework
source scripts/cli-pipeline/base-classes/multi-worktree-framework.sh

# Register your group (replace with your group name)
register_worktree_group "[alpha|beta|gamma]" "$(pwd)" "[your-pipeline-count]-pipelines"
```

### **1.2 Create Working Directories**
```bash
# Create directories for coordination and tracking
mkdir -p temp/migration-plans
mkdir -p temp/analysis-reports  
mkdir -p temp/archived-code
mkdir -p temp/test-results

# Initialize progress tracking
echo "timestamp|group|pipeline|status|notes" > temp/group-progress.log
echo "# Group [Alpha|Beta|Gamma] Migration Log" > temp/group-migration-log.md
```

### **1.3 Validate Assignment List**
Review your group's assigned pipelines from the group assignment document and verify they exist:

```bash
# For Group Alpha (example - adjust for your group)
ASSIGNED_PIPELINES=(
    "all-pipelines-cli.sh"
    "deployment-cli.sh" 
    "database-cli.sh"
    "proxy-cli.sh"
    # ... add your complete list
)

# Verify all assigned pipelines exist
for pipeline in "${ASSIGNED_PIPELINES[@]}"; do
    if [[ -f "scripts/cli-pipeline/*/$pipeline" ]]; then
        echo "✅ Found: $pipeline"
    else
        echo "❌ Missing: $pipeline"
    fi
done
```

---

## 📊 **Phase 2: Pipeline Analysis (15-30 minutes per pipeline)**

### **2.1 Individual Pipeline Analysis**

For each assigned pipeline, follow this detailed analysis process:

#### **Step 2.1.1: Basic Information Gathering**
```bash
# Set variables for current pipeline
PIPELINE_NAME="example-cli.sh"  # Replace with actual pipeline
PIPELINE_PATH=$(find scripts/cli-pipeline -name "$PIPELINE_NAME" | head -1)
GROUP_NAME="[alpha|beta|gamma]"  # Your group name

# Verify pipeline exists
if [[ ! -f "$PIPELINE_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Pipeline not found: $PIPELINE_NAME"
    exit 1
fi

echo "🔍 Analyzing: $PIPELINE_NAME"
echo "📁 Path: $PIPELINE_PATH"
```

#### **Step 2.1.2: Complexity Analysis**
```bash
# Run automated complexity analysis
complexity=$(analyze_pipeline_complexity "$PIPELINE_PATH")
domain=$(get_pipeline_domain "$PIPELINE_NAME")

echo "📊 Complexity: $complexity"
echo "🏷️  Domain: $domain"
```

#### **Step 2.1.3: Functional Analysis**
Create detailed functional analysis:

```bash
# Create analysis report
ANALYSIS_FILE="temp/analysis-reports/analysis-$PIPELINE_NAME.md"

cat > "$ANALYSIS_FILE" << EOF
# Functional Analysis: $PIPELINE_NAME

## Basic Information
- **Group**: $GROUP_NAME
- **Path**: $PIPELINE_PATH
- **Complexity**: $complexity
- **Domain**: $domain
- **Analysis Date**: $(date)

## Current Functionality
EOF

# Analyze current commands
echo "### Available Commands" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
if grep -E "^[[:space:]]*[a-zA-Z_-]+\)" "$PIPELINE_PATH" | grep -v "esac\|;;"; then
    grep -E "^[[:space:]]*[a-zA-Z_-]+\)" "$PIPELINE_PATH" | grep -v "esac\|;;" | while read -r line; do
        command=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/).*//; s/^[[:space:]]*//')
        echo "- **$command** - [Add description after manual review]" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
    done
else
    echo "- No clear command structure found - requires manual analysis" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
fi

# Analyze service dependencies
echo "" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
echo "### Service Dependencies" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
if grep -i "service\|import\|require" "$PIPELINE_PATH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    grep -i "service\|import\|require" "$PIPELINE_PATH" | head -10 | while read -r line; do
        echo "- \`$line\`" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
    done
else
    echo "- No obvious service dependencies found" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
fi

# Add sections for manual completion
cat >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE" << EOF

### Current Issues/Problems
[Review pipeline manually and list issues found]

### Dependencies on Other Pipelines
[Check if this pipeline calls other pipelines]

### External Dependencies
[List any external tools, APIs, or services required]

### Usage Frequency
[Check command tracking data if available]

## Recommended Migration Approach
[To be filled during Step 2.2]
EOF

echo "📄 Analysis template created: $ANALYSIS_FILE"
```

#### **Step 2.1.4: Manual Review and Completion**
**🚨 CRITICAL: Human review required**

1. **Open the analysis file** in your editor
2. **Read through the entire pipeline** to understand functionality
3. **Complete the manual sections**:
   - Current Issues/Problems
   - Dependencies on Other Pipelines  
   - External Dependencies
   - Usage Frequency (check logs if available)
4. **Verify the command list** and add proper descriptions
5. **Update service dependencies** with actual service names

### **2.2 Base Class Selection**

Based on your analysis, determine the appropriate base class:

```bash
# Decision tree for base class selection
echo "🤔 Determining base class for $PIPELINE_NAME..."

# Add this to your analysis file
echo "" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
echo "## Base Class Recommendation" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"

# Simple decision logic (customize based on analysis)
if [[ "$domain" == "INFRASTRUCTURE" || "$PIPELINE_NAME" == *"server"* || "$PIPELINE_NAME" == *"proxy"* ]]; then
    base_class="ServiceCLIPipeline"
    echo "**Recommended**: ServiceCLIPipeline (service management focus)" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
elif [[ "$complexity" == "LOW" && "$domain" == "UTILITIES" ]]; then
    base_class="SimpleCLIPipeline"  
    echo "**Recommended**: SimpleCLIPipeline (utility operations)" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
elif [[ "$domain" == "MEDIA" || "$domain" == "GOOGLE" || "$domain" == "DOCUMENTS" ]]; then
    base_class="ProcessingCLIPipeline"
    echo "**Recommended**: ProcessingCLIPipeline (data processing workflows)" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
elif [[ "$domain" == "SYSTEM" || "$PIPELINE_NAME" == *"all-pipeline"* ]]; then
    base_class="ManagementCLIPipeline"
    echo "**Recommended**: ManagementCLIPipeline (system administration)" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
else
    base_class="CLIPipelineBase"
    echo "**Recommended**: CLIPipelineBase (custom implementation needed)" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
fi

echo "📋 Base class selected: $base_class"
```

### **2.3 Generate Migration Plan**
```bash
# Generate detailed migration plan
plan_file=$(generate_migration_plan "$PIPELINE_PATH" "$GROUP_NAME")
echo "📋 Migration plan generated: $plan_file"

# Update analysis with migration plan reference
echo "**Migration Plan**: $plan_file" >> "$ANALYSIS_FILE"
```

---

## 🔧 **Phase 3: Migration Implementation (45-90 minutes per pipeline)**

### **3.1 Pre-Migration Backup**
```bash
# Create backup of original pipeline
BACKUP_FILE="temp/archived-code/$(basename $PIPELINE_PATH .sh).$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sh"
cp "$PIPELINE_PATH" "$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "💾 Backup created: $BACKUP_FILE"

# Update progress tracking
update_pipeline_progress "$GROUP_NAME" "$PIPELINE_NAME" "backup_created" "Original pipeline backed up"
```

### **3.2 Identify Code for Archival**
**Before modifying the pipeline**, identify code to archive:

```bash
# Review pipeline for archival candidates
echo "🗄️  Reviewing code for archival in: $PIPELINE_NAME"

# Common archival targets:
# 1. Outdated command implementations
# 2. Commented-out code blocks  
# 3. Redundant functions
# 4. Legacy configuration handling
# 5. Deprecated service integrations

# Create archival log
ARCHIVAL_LOG="temp/archived-code/archival-log-$PIPELINE_NAME.md"
cat > "$ARCHIVAL_LOG" << EOF
# Code Archival Log: $PIPELINE_NAME

## Items Identified for Archival
- [ ] [List specific functions, commands, or code blocks to remove]
- [ ] [Include line numbers and reasons for archival]

## Archival Actions Taken
[Document what was actually archived]

## Remaining Technical Debt
[Note any issues that should be addressed later]
EOF

echo "📝 Archival log created: $ARCHIVAL_LOG"
```

**🚨 Manual Step Required**: Review the pipeline and complete the archival log.

### **3.3 Implement Base Class Migration**

#### **Step 3.3.1: Create New Pipeline Structure**
```bash
# Create new pipeline based on selected base class
NEW_PIPELINE_PATH="$PIPELINE_PATH.new"

echo "🔨 Creating new pipeline structure: $NEW_PIPELINE_PATH"

# Generate basic structure (customize based on base class)
cat > "$NEW_PIPELINE_PATH" << EOF
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# $PIPELINE_NAME - Migrated to use CLI Pipeline Framework
# Original functionality preserved with standardized base class

# Source the appropriate base class
source "\$(dirname "\${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../../base-classes/$base_class.sh"

# Pipeline configuration
PIPELINE_NAME="$(basename $PIPELINE_NAME .sh)"
PIPELINE_DESCRIPTION="[Add description from analysis]"
PIPELINE_VERSION="2.0.0"

# Initialize the pipeline
init_cli_pipeline "\$PIPELINE_NAME" "\$PIPELINE_DESCRIPTION" "\$@"

# Service integration setup
setup_service_integrations() {
    # Check for required services and set up integrations
    # [This will be customized based on service analysis]
    :
}

# Initialize service integrations
setup_service_integrations

# Command implementations (migrated from original)
# [Commands will be added in next step]

# Main command routing
case "\$1" in
    "")
        log_error "No command specified"
        show_help
        exit 1
        ;;
    *)
        route_command "\$@"
        ;;
esac
EOF

echo "✅ Basic structure created"
```

#### **Step 3.3.2: Migrate Command Functions**
**🚨 Critical Manual Step**: Migrate each command from the original pipeline:

```bash
echo "🔄 Migrating commands from original pipeline..."
echo "📖 Original pipeline: $PIPELINE_PATH"
echo "📝 New pipeline: $NEW_PIPELINE_PATH"

# Update progress
update_pipeline_progress "$GROUP_NAME" "$PIPELINE_NAME" "migrating_commands" "Converting commands to base class pattern"
```

**For each command in the original pipeline:**

1. **Identify the command** in the original file
2. **Convert to the new pattern**:
   ```bash
   # Original pattern (example):
   case "$1" in
       "some-command")
           # Original implementation
           ;;
   
   # New pattern:
   command_some_command() {
       local param1="$1"
       local description="Description of what this command does"
       
       # Parameter validation (if needed)
       if [[ -z "$param1" ]]; then
           log_error "Parameter required"
           log_info "Usage: $0 some-command <param1>"
           return 1
       fi
       
       # Execute with tracking
       track_and_execute "some_command" "$description" \
           actual_command_implementation "$param1"
   }
   ```

3. **Handle service integrations**:
   ```bash
   # Example service integration in command
   command_database_query() {
       local query="$1"
       
       # Use service integration framework
       local db_service_path
       db_service_path=$(get_service_with_fallback "database-service" "$PIPELINE_NAME" "$GROUP_NAME")
       
       if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
           # Use the service
           track_and_execute "db_query" "Execute database query" \
               npx ts-node -e "import { DatabaseService } from '$db_service_path'; ..."
       else
           # Fallback implementation
           log_warn "Using fallback database implementation"
           # ... fallback code
       fi
   }
   ```

### **3.4 Service Integration Implementation**

#### **Step 3.4.1: Identify Required Services**
```bash
echo "🔌 Implementing service integrations for: $PIPELINE_NAME"

# Based on your analysis, implement service integration
# Update the setup_service_integrations function:

# Example for a pipeline that needs multiple services:
SERVICES_NEEDED=(
    "database-service"
    "logger-service"  
    "file-system-service"
    # Add based on your analysis
)

# Add service integration code to the new pipeline
# [This is done manually by editing the file]
```

#### **Step 3.4.2: Implement Service Fallbacks**
For each service needed:

1. **Check if refactored version exists**
2. **Use get_service_with_fallback function**
3. **Implement fallback if service not available**
4. **Log glitches for missing services**

Example implementation:
```bash
# Add this to the setup_service_integrations function
setup_service_integrations() {
    log_info "Setting up service integrations for $PIPELINE_NAME"
    
    # Database service
    DB_SERVICE_PATH=$(get_service_with_fallback "database-service" "$PIPELINE_NAME" "$GROUP_NAME")
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        log_warn "Database service not available - using direct database access"
        DB_SERVICE_AVAILABLE=false
    else
        DB_SERVICE_AVAILABLE=true
    fi
    
    # Add similar blocks for other services
}
```

### **3.5 Archive Old Code**
```bash
# Move old code to archive
ARCHIVE_PATH="temp/archived-code/$(basename $PIPELINE_PATH .sh).original.$(date +%Y%m%d).sh"
mv "$PIPELINE_PATH" "$ARCHIVE_PATH"

# Replace with new implementation  
mv "$NEW_PIPELINE_PATH" "$PIPELINE_PATH"

# Make executable
chmod +x "$PIPELINE_PATH"

echo "🗄️  Original archived: $ARCHIVE_PATH"
echo "✅ New implementation active: $PIPELINE_PATH"

# Update progress
update_pipeline_progress "$GROUP_NAME" "$PIPELINE_NAME" "migration_complete" "Pipeline migrated to base class framework"
```

COMMANDS=$($PIPELINE_PATH --help | grep -E "^  [a-zA-Z]" | awk '{print $1}' || echo "")

if [[ -n "$COMMANDS" ]]; then
    while IFS= read -r cmd; do
        echo "Testing command: $cmd"
        
        # Test command exists (doesn't fail with "unknown command")
        if $PIPELINE_PATH "$cmd" --help >/dev/null 2>&1 || $PIPELINE_PATH "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "✅ Command '$cmd' responds"
        else
            echo "❌ Command '$cmd' failed"
            submit_glitch "$PIPELINE_NAME" "$GROUP_NAME" "command_error" "Command $cmd not working" "medium"

end_time=$(date +%s.%N)
duration=$(echo "$end_time - $start_time" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

echo "Help command execution time: ${duration}s"

# If available, compare with original (from backup)
if [[ -f "$BACKUP_FILE" ]]; then
    start_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    $BACKUP_FILE --help >/dev/null 2>&1
    end_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    original_duration=$(echo "$end_time - $start_time" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
    
    echo "Original execution time: ${original_duration}s"

### **4.4 Integration Testing**
```bash
echo "Testing service integrations..."

# Test each service integration
for service in "${SERVICES_NEEDED[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing $service integration..."
    
    # This is pipeline-specific - add actual integration tests
    # Example: if the pipeline has a command that uses the service, test it
    
    echo "⚠️  Manual integration testing required for $service"
done

# Update progress
update_pipeline_progress "$GROUP_NAME" "$PIPELINE_NAME" "testing_integration" "Service integration testing completed"
```

## 🔄 **Phase 6: Quality Gates & Coordination (10 minutes per pipeline)**

### **6.1 Quality Gate Checklist**
Before marking a pipeline as complete, verify:

```bash
echo "🎯 Running quality gate checklist for: $PIPELINE_NAME"

QUALITY_CHECKLIST=(
    "Help system responds correctly"
    "Debug mode functions properly"  
    "All original commands preserved"
    "Service integrations implemented"
    "Performance maintained or improved"
    "Error handling standardized"
    "Documentation updated"
    "Database tracking updated"
    "Test report created"
    "Original code archived"
)

echo "Quality Gate Checklist:"
for item in "${QUALITY_CHECKLIST[@]}"; do
    echo "- [ ] $item"
done

echo ""
echo "⚠️  Manual verification required for all checklist items"
echo "⚠️  Do not proceed to next pipeline until all items verified"
```

### **6.2 Cross-Group Coordination Check**
```bash
echo "🤝 Checking for cross-group coordination needs..."

# Check if this pipeline has dependencies on other groups' work
case "$PIPELINE_NAME" in
    *database*|*all-pipeline*)
        echo "⚠️  This pipeline may affect other groups - coordinate before completion"
        ;;
    *service*|*registry*)
        echo "⚠️  Service-related pipeline - may impact other groups"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "✅ No obvious cross-group dependencies"
        ;;
esac

# Check for conflicts with other groups
if ! check_pipeline_conflicts "$PIPELINE_NAME" "$GROUP_NAME"; then
    echo "⚠️  Potential conflict detected - coordinate with other groups"
fi
```

### **6.3 Final Validation**
```bash
echo "🏁 Final validation for: $PIPELINE_NAME"

# Ensure pipeline is executable and functional
if [[ -x "$PIPELINE_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "✅ Pipeline is executable"
else
    echo "❌ Pipeline is not executable"
    chmod +x "$PIPELINE_PATH"
fi

# Test basic functionality one more time
if $PIPELINE_PATH --help >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "✅ Final functionality test passed"
else
    echo "❌ Final functionality test failed"
    echo "🚨 DO NOT MARK AS COMPLETE - INVESTIGATE ISSUE"
    exit 1
fi

echo "🎉 $PIPELINE_NAME ready for production!"
```

---

## 📋 **Phase 7: Batch Operations & Group Completion**

### **7.1 Daily Group Coordination**
At the end of each day:

```bash
# Generate daily status report
./scripts/cli-pipeline/base-classes/generate-daily-report.sh "$GROUP_NAME"

# Coordinate with other groups
coordinate_worktrees "status" "$GROUP_NAME"

# Sync any shared resources
coordinate_worktrees "sync" "$GROUP_NAME"
```

### **7.2 Group Completion Process**
When all assigned pipelines are complete:

```bash
echo "🎊 All pipelines completed for Group $GROUP_NAME!"

# Generate final group report
final_report=$(generate_group_report "$GROUP_NAME")
echo "📊 Final report: $final_report"

# Coordinate completion with other groups
coordinate_worktrees "complete" "$GROUP_NAME"

# Prepare for merge back to main branch
echo "⚠️  Ready for merge coordination with other groups"
```

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Pipeline Migration Fails**
1. **STOP immediately** - don't continue with broken pipeline
2. **Restore from backup**: `cp "$BACKUP_FILE" "$PIPELINE_PATH"`
3. **Document the issue** in detail
4. **Submit high-priority glitch** with full error details
5. **Move to next pipeline** - return to failed one later
6. **Coordinate with other groups** if issue affects multiple pipelines

### **Service Integration Issues**
1. **Use fallback implementation** to maintain functionality
2. **Submit glitch** with service details for batch resolution
3. **Document workaround** for future reference
4. **Continue with migration** - don't block on service issues

### **Cross-Group Conflicts**
1. **Pause work** on conflicting pipeline
2. **Immediately coordinate** with other group
3. **Determine resolution** approach
4. **Document resolution** for future reference
5. **Update coordination framework** to prevent future conflicts
