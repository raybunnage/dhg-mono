# Phase 2 Complete: DatabaseMetadataService & WorkSummaryService Extraction

## Overview
Phase 2 of the dhg-admin-code shared services extraction has been successfully completed. Two major services have been extracted and integrated.

## Services Extracted

### 1. DatabaseMetadataService
**Location**: `packages/shared/services/database-metadata-service/`

**Features**:
- Comprehensive database introspection (tables, views, columns, indexes, foreign keys)
- Table statistics (row counts, sizes, creation dates)
- Prefix analysis and categorization
- Export capabilities (CSV, SQL schema)
- Singleton pattern with browser compatibility

**Integration**:
- Updated `DatabasePage.tsx` to use the service
- Fixed async state management issue with prefixes
- Maintained full backward compatibility

### 2. WorkSummaryService
**Location**: `packages/shared/services/work-summary-service/`

**Features**:
- Full CRUD operations for work summaries
- Advanced filtering (by category, status, worktree, date range, tags)
- Work summary statistics and analytics
- Combined work items view (summaries + tasks)
- Search by commands and UI components
- Export functionality
- Tag and category management

**Integration**:
- Updated `WorkSummaries.tsx` to use the service
- Updated `WorkSummariesEnhanced.tsx` including save functionality
- Maintained full backward compatibility

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reusability**: Both services are now available to any app in the monorepo
2. **Maintainability**: Database and work summary logic centralized
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all operations
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Both services use singleton pattern with dependency injection
5. **Feature Enhancement**: Services include additional functionality beyond original implementation

## Statistics
- **Files Created**: 8 (4 per service)
- **Lines of Code Extracted**: ~1,200
- **Components Updated**: 3 (DatabasePage, WorkSummaries, WorkSummariesEnhanced)
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
The following services are ready for extraction:
1. WorktreeManagementService - Worktree mapping and management
2. CommandExecutionService - Git command execution and tracking

## Testing Notes
All updated components continue to function exactly as before, confirming successful extraction with no breaking changes.
