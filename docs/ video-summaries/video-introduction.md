# Introduction to "Mitochondrial Medicine and Cell Danger Response 102"

## About the Speaker

**Dr. Robert Naviaux ("Bob Naviaux")**
- Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics, and Pathology at the University of California San Diego
- Has been at UCSD for approximately 30 years
- Leading researcher focusing exclusively on mitochondria "from conception to old age"
- Pioneer in establishing the scientific foundation behind clinical concepts related to mitochondrial function
- Known for his work on the Cell Danger Response (CDR) and how it relates to chronic illness

## About the Host

**Dr. David Hanskum**
- Semi-retired physician who left clinical practice in 2019
- Left conventional medicine after concluding that many medical practices were potentially harmful due to insufficient understanding of physiology
- Joined Sue Carter and Steve Porges' group in 2020
- Currently serving as moderator for this presentation

## About the Presentation

This is a "102" follow-up session on mitochondrial medicine and the Cell Danger Response, designed to revisit and deepen understanding of concepts previously introduced. The presentation aims to:

1. Expand beyond the traditional view of mitochondria as merely the "powerhouse of the cell"
2. Explain how mitochondria function as coordinating centers for all cellular metabolism
3. Explore the role of mitochondria as the first line of defense against threats
4. Discuss both "bottom-up" and "top-down" perspectives on chronic illness
5. Examine how cell danger signals persist in chronic conditions
6. Address the balance between personalized therapies (unique to individuals) and generalized approaches (targeting shared abnormalities)

The session is structured as an interview/discussion format with Dr. Hanskum asking questions to help clarify and expand on Dr. Naviaux's research findings and their clinical implications.
