# Document Types Page Implementation

## Overview

Successfully created a new Document Types management page in dhg-admin-code that supports the hierarchical document type design with general categories and specific types.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hierarchical Display
- **General Types**: Categories displayed as expandable groups
- **Specific Types**: Listed under their respective categories
- Collapsible/expandable category groups for better organization
- Visual distinction between general and specific types

### 2. Full CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new document types (both general and specific)
- **Read**: List and view all document types with details
- **Update**: Edit existing document types
- **Delete**: Remove document types with confirmation

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Search**: Filter by name, category, description, or mnemonic
- **Category Filter**: View types from specific categories
- **Duplicate**: Clone existing types for quick creation
- **AI Generated Indicator**: Shows which types were created by AI
- **JSON Schema Support**: Edit expected JSON schemas for types
- **Metadata Display**: Shows creation dates, prompts, and schemas

### 4. User Interface
- Clean, modern design matching dhg-admin-code style
- Responsive layout with statistics cards
- Modal forms for create/edit operations
- Inline actions with hover states
- Double-click delete confirmation for safety

## Implementation Details

### File Created
- `/apps/dhg-admin-code/src/pages/DocumentTypes.tsx`

### Integration Points
- Added route in `App.tsx`: `/document-types`
- Added navigation tab in `DashboardLayout.tsx`: "Doc Types"
- Uses Supabase client for all database operations
- Follows existing authentication patterns

### Database Schema Used
```typescript
interface DocumentType {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string | null;
  description: string | null;
  is_general_type: boolean | null;
  is_ai_generated: boolean | null;
  mnemonic: string | null;
  prompt_id: string | null;
  expected_json_schema: any | null;
  created_at: string | null;
  updated_at: string | null;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a General Type
1. Click "New Document Type"
2. Enter category name (e.g., "Research Documents")
3. Check "General Type (Category)"
4. Add description
5. Save

### Creating a Specific Type
1. Click "New Document Type"
2. Enter name (e.g., "Literature Review")
3. Enter category (e.g., "Research Documents")
4. Optionally add mnemonic, description, prompt ID
5. Save

### Managing Types
- Click category headers to expand/collapse
- Use search to find specific types
- Filter by category for focused view
- Edit, duplicate, or delete using inline buttons
- Delete requires double-click for confirmation

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Page renders with proper layout
- [x] Navigation tab appears and is functional
- [x] Search functionality works
- [x] Category filtering works
- [x] Create modal opens and closes
- [x] Edit modal populates with existing data
- [x] Delete confirmation works
- [x] Duplicate functionality creates copy
- [x] General vs specific type distinction is clear
- [x] Expandable categories work properly

## CLI Integration

The page works seamlessly with the existing document_types CLI pipeline:
- `./document-types-cli.sh list` - View all types
- `./document-types-cli.sh create` - Create new types
- `./document-types-cli.sh update` - Update existing types
- `./document-types-cli.sh delete` - Remove types
- `./document-types-cli.sh stats` - View statistics

Changes made through the UI are immediately reflected in CLI commands and vice versa.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Select multiple types for bulk actions
2. **Import/Export**: JSON/CSV import and export functionality
3. **Validation**: Real-time JSON schema validation
4. **Analytics**: Usage statistics and trends
5. **Templates**: Pre-defined type templates
6. **Relationships**: Visual representation of type relationships
7. **Version History**: Track changes to document types over time
