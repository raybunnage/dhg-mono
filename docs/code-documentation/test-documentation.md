# Test Documentation File

This is a test documentation file to demonstrate the functionality of the documentation system.

## Introduction

Documentation is essential for any software project. It helps developers understand the codebase, makes onboarding easier, and serves as a reference for future development.

### Why Documentation Matters

Good documentation can:
- Reduce the time needed to understand code
- Improve collaboration between team members
- Serve as a knowledge base for the project
- Help new developers get up to speed quickly

## Features of Our Documentation System

The documentation system in this project includes several key features:

1. **Markdown Support**: All documentation is written in Markdown format
2. **Automatic Indexing**: Documents are automatically indexed and searchable
3. **Section Analysis**: Each section is analyzed and summarized
4. **Relationship Detection**: Links between documents are detected automatically

### File Processing

When a markdown file is added to the system, it goes through these steps:

1. The file is indexed and basic metadata is extracted
2. Sections (headings) are identified and stored
3. File is added to the processing queue
4. AI processing extracts summaries and tags
5. Relationships with other documents are identified

## Technical Implementation

Our system uses the following technologies:
- React for the frontend
- Supabase for the database
- TypeScript for type safety
- Markdown processing libraries

### Database Schema

The database schema includes these tables:
- `documentation_files` - Stores metadata about each file
- `documentation_sections` - Stores sections from each file
- `documentation_relations` - Stores relationships between files
- `documentation_processing_queue` - Manages the processing queue

## Conclusion

This test document demonstrates various features of the documentation system, including headings at different levels, links to other documents, and content that can be analyzed.
