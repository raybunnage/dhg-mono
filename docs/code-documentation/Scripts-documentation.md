# Scripts Documentation

## Overview
The Scripts page provides a comprehensive interface for managing, viewing, and interacting with script files in the system. It allows users to browse scripts organized by folders, view script content, see AI-generated summaries, and perform actions like copying, archiving, and deleting scripts.

## Basic Information
- **File Path:** src/pages/Scripts.tsx
- **Primary Components:** Scripts component, ScriptViewer
- **Routes:** /scripts

## Code Quality Assessment
### Strengths
- Well-organized component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Consistent UI patterns and component reuse
- Detailed comments explaining component functionality and logic
- Efficient state management using React hooks

### Areas for Improvement
- Large component (over 1000 lines) could be refactored into smaller sub-components
- Some redundant code in search functionality could be consolidated
- Multiple similar string manipulations (like file path handling) could be extracted to utility functions
- Inline styles in some components could be moved to Tailwind classes for consistency

### Scores
- **Maintainability:** 3/5 - Well-organized but large file size makes modifications challenging
- **Readability:** 4/5 - Good commenting and consistent structure enhance readability

## Size and Complexity
- **Lines of Code:** 1011
- **Component Breakdown:** 1 main component with several nested rendering functions
- **Complexity Assessment:** High complexity in the search functionality and folder organization logic

### Refactoring Recommendations
- Extract folder organization logic into a custom hook
- Create separate components for:
  - ScriptList
  - ScriptFolder
  - ScriptSummary
  - ScriptActions
- Move utility functions like formatFileSize, formatDate to shared utility files
- Create a dedicated search service to handle the search logic

## Integration with Shared Services
### Existing Services That Could Be Leveraged
- scriptFileService: Already integrated for file operations
- Could use a shared Toast service instead of direct toast calls
- Common date/time formatting utilities could be extracted

### Recommended New Services
- ScriptSearchService: Handle searching and filtering of scripts
- ScriptMetadataService: Process and standardize metadata extraction
- FolderOrganizationService: Handle organizing scripts into folder hierarchies

## Function and Dependency Analysis
### Key Functions
- `fetchScripts()`: Fetches script data from Supabase
- `fetchDocumentTypes()`: Fetches document types from Supabase
- `organizeScriptsByFolder()`: Organizes scripts into a folder structure
- `handleSearch()`: Manages search functionality
- `handleDeleteScript()`: Deletes script files and database records
- `handleArchiveScript()`: Archives script files
- `formatFileSize()`: Formats file size for display
- `formatDate()`: Formats dates for display
- `selectScript()`: Selects a script to view

### Dependencies
- React, useState, useEffect: Core React functionality
- supabase: Database client
- scriptFileService: Script file operations
- toast: Notification system
- Database types from Supabase

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Supabase for data fetching and modification
- Uses ScriptViewer component for rendering script content
- Interacts with the file system via scriptFileService

## Special UI Implementations
### Reusable Patterns
- Folder tree view with collapsible folders
- Status badge system for script importance and recommendations
- Script metadata display panels
- Summary collapsible panels

### Educational Code Examples
```tsx
// Script importance indicator with color coding
{script.summary?.importance && (
  <div className="mr-1">
    {script.summary.importance.toLowerCase().includes('critical') && (
      <span className="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-red-500" title="Critical Importance"></span>
    )}
    {script.summary.importance.toLowerCase().includes('high') && (
      <span className="inline-block w-3 h-3 rounded-full bg-orange-500" title="High Importance"></span>
    )}
    // Additional importance levels...
  </div>
)}
```

## Additional Insights
- **Performance**: Handles large script lists effectively with client-side search optimization
- **Accessibility**: Uses semantic HTML but could benefit from more ARIA attributes
- **State Management**: Uses React's useState effectively but could consider context for deeply nested components
- **Potential Bugs**: Path normalization could cause issues on different operating systems
- **Security**: Properly validates and sanitizes input before database operations
- **Browser Compatibility**: Uses standard JS/CSS features that work across modern browsers
