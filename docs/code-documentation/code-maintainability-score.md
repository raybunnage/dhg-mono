# Code Maintainability Score

## Overview
The code maintainability score is a metric used to assess how easy or difficult it is to maintain, modify, and extend a codebase. It uses a 1-5 scale with the following meanings:

- **1**: Extremely difficult to maintain
- **2**: Difficult to maintain
- **3**: Moderately maintainable
- **4**: Easy to maintain
- **5**: Excellent maintainability

## Scoring Criteria

The maintainability score is based on these key factors:

1. **Code Complexity**: How complex is the control flow and logic?
2. **Documentation**: How well is the code documented?
3. **Modularity**: How well is the code separated into cohesive modules?
4. **Test Coverage**: How comprehensive are the tests?
5. **Consistency**: How consistent is the coding style and patterns?
6. **Dependencies**: How manageable are the dependencies?

## Using the Score

The maintainability score should be used to:
- Identify areas of the codebase that need refactoring
- Track improvements in code quality over time
- Prioritize technical debt reduction
- Set standards for code reviews

## Examples

### Score 1 Example (Poor)
- No documentation
- Complex, nested conditionals (cyclomatic complexity > 15)
- No tests
- Inconsistent naming and formatting
- Tight coupling between components
- Duplicate code throughout

### Score 5 Example (Excellent)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Simple, focused functions (cyclomatic complexity < 5)
- High test coverage
- Consistent style following project standards
- Clear separation of concerns
- DRY principles followed throughout
