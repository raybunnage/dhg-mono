# Supabase Design System

## Overview

The Supabase Design System is a comprehensive set of tools for managing, understanding, and interacting with your Supabase database. It provides an intuitive interface to handle database operations, migrations, and schema management.

## Components

The Supabase Design System consists of:

1. **Supabase Manager**: A full-featured database management UI
2. **Database Functions**: PostgreSQL functions that power the manager
3. **Type Generation**: Tools to generate and maintain TypeScript types
4. **Migration Management**: Systems for tracking and applying database changes
5. **Documentation**: Guides and references for database best practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Supabase project with a PostgreSQL database
- Appropriate permissions to create functions and tables
- Frontend application using React and a routing solution

### Installation

1. Apply the database functions migration to your Supabase database:
   ```sql
   -- Run this in the SQL Editor
   -- Contents of 20250301000000_create_database_manager_functions.sql
   ```

2. Add the SupabaseManager component to your application
3. Set up routes to access the manager
4. Configure permissions as appropriate for your users

## Key Features

### Database Dashboard

Get a high-level overview of your database health:
- Table count, row distributions, and sizes
- Schema inconsistencies and optimization opportunities
- Quick access to common database operations

### Schema Management

Explore and manage your database structure:
- View tables, columns, relationships, and constraints
- Create new database objects using templates
- Identify and fix schema issues

### SQL Editor

Run SQL queries and view results:
- Execute arbitrary SQL (with permissions)
- View results in a tabular format
- Use templates for common operations

### Migration Management

Track and manage database changes:
- Record migrations with timestamps and status
- Review migration history
- Generate migration scripts from templates

### Type Generation

Keep your TypeScript types in sync with your database:
- Generate types.ts from current schema
- Use types in frontend for type-safe database access
- Track changes to schema and types

## Documentation

- [Supabase Manager Guide](./supabase-manager-guide.md) - Comprehensive guide to the Supabase Manager
- [Integration](./integration.md) - How to integrate the manager into your application
- [Database Functions](./database-functions.md) - Reference for the PostgreSQL functions

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import SupabaseManager from '@/components/SupabaseManager';

function DatabasePage() {
  return <SupabaseManager />;
}
```

### With Routing

```tsx
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import SupabaseManager from '@/components/SupabaseManager';

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/database/*" element={<SupabaseManager />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
