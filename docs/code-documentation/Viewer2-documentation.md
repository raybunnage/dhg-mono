# Viewer2 Documentation

## Overview
The Viewer2 page provides an alternative file browsing interface focused on specific target folders in Google Drive. It includes functionality to search for specific root folders, fetch their content hierarchies, fix path relationships, and insert files into the database. This page appears to be an enhanced version of the original Viewer with more specific targeting capabilities.

## Basic Information
- **File Path:** src/pages/Viewer2.tsx
- **Primary Components:** FileTree2, insertGoogleFiles, fixPathsInDatabase
- **Routes:** /viewer2

## Code Quality Assessment
### Strengths
- Targeted folder searching capability with multiple fallback strategies
- Strong error handling throughout the file operations
- Clear logging for troubleshooting and debugging
- Good use of TypeScript for type safety
- Effective separation of concerns between different file operations

### Areas for Improvement
- Excessive function sizes, particularly in folder search and file fetching methods
- Multiple nested loops and conditionals in the fetchNestedFilesForTargetFolders function
- Significant code duplication between this component and the original Viewer
- Redundant logging statements could be moved to a dedicated logger utility
- Large component with too many responsibilities (search, fetch, display, repair, insert)

### Scores
- **Maintainability:** 2/5 - The component contains several very large functions with complex logic that would be difficult to maintain and modify
- **Readability:** 3/5 - While naming conventions are good, the excessive function sizes and complex logic paths make the code challenging to follow

## Size and Complexity
- **Lines of Code:** 752
- **Component Breakdown:** 1 main component with extensive internal logic
- **Complexity Assessment:** Very high complexity. The component contains multiple large functions with complex logic paths, nested conditionals, and various data processing algorithms.

### Refactoring Recommendations
- Split the component into multiple smaller components focused on specific tasks
- Extract the folder searching logic to a dedicated service
- Create a custom hook for file hierarchy fetching and processing
- Move the path fixing functions to a shared utility
- Implement proper loading and error states with dedicated UI components
- Reduce duplication by sharing code with the original Viewer component

## Integration with Shared Services
### Existing Services That Could Be Leveraged
- `googleDriveService` - Already imported but some functions are reimplemented
- `supabase/client` - In use but lacks a consistent wrapper service

### Recommended New Services
- **TargetFolderService**: A service to search for and manage target folders
- **FileHierarchyService**: A dedicated service for handling nested file structures
- **PathRepairService**: Centralized service for fixing file path issues
- **DatabaseInsertionService**: A service to handle database operations for file insertion
- **LoggingService**: A standardized logging utility that can be used across components

## Function and Dependency Analysis
### Key Functions
- `Viewer2()`: Main component function
- `findTargetRootFolders()`: Searches for specific root folders by name
- `fetchNestedFilesForTargetFolders()`: Recursively fetches all files within target folders
- `handleFixPaths()`: Triggers path fixing in the database
- `handleInsertFiles()`: Prepares and inserts files into the database

### Dependencies
- `react`: Core UI library
- `react-hot-toast`: Toast notifications
- `@/integrations/supabase/client`: Supabase database client
- `@/components/FileTree2`: Custom file tree component
- `@/services/googleDriveService`: Service for Google Drive operations

### Integration Points
- Integrates with Supabase sources_google table for file data
- Uses googleDriveService for insertGoogleFiles and fixPathsInDatabase functions
- Connects with FileTree2 component to display hierarchical file data
- Utilizes toast notifications for user feedback

## Special UI Implementations
### Reusable Patterns
- **Target Folder Display**: Shows found root folders with detailed metadata
- **Operation Status Cards**: Displays results of database operations with success/error counts
- **Action Button Array**: Organized set of action buttons with consistent styling
- **Hierarchical File Browser**: Tree-based file navigation system

### Educational Code Examples
```tsx
// File hierarchy traversal with circular reference prevention
const collectAllDescendants = (item: any, collected = new Set<string>()) => {
  if (!item || collected.has(item.id)) {
    return collected; // Prevent circular references
  }
  
  collected.add(item.id);
  
  // Try all child relationship maps
  const childrenByFolderId = childrenByParentFolderId.get(item.id) || [];
  const childrenByDriveId = item.drive_id ? (childrenByParentFolderId.get(item.drive_id) || []) : [];
  const childrenById = childrenByParentId.get(item.id) || [];
  const childrenByPath = item.path ? (childrenByParentPath.get(item.path) || []) : [];
  
  // Combine all children from different sources, avoiding duplicates
  const allChildren = new Map();
  [...childrenByFolderId, ...childrenByDriveId, ...childrenById, ...childrenByPath].forEach(child => {
    if (!allChildren.has(child.id)) {
      allChildren.set(child.id, child);
    }
  });
  
  // Process all unique children
  Array.from(allChildren.values()).forEach(child => {
    // Skip if we've already seen this child
    if (collected.has(child.id)) return;
    
    // Add this child
    collected.add(child.id);
    
    // Only recursively process folders
    if (child.mime_type === 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder') {
      collectAllDescendants(child, collected);
    }
  });
  
  return collected;
};
```

## Additional Insights
### Performance Considerations
- The recursive file fetching could cause performance issues with large file hierarchies
- Multiple mapping and filtering operations on large datasets could be optimized
- No pagination or limiting of results when dealing with potentially large file sets
- Extensive console logging could impact performance in production environments

### Accessibility
- Limited keyboard navigation support in the file tree
- Status messages and operation results lack proper ARIA attributes
- Success/error states rely primarily on color differentiation without alternative indicators
- Interactive elements like buttons have inconsistent focus states

### State Management
- Uses local React useState hooks for managing component state
- No global state management despite complex data relationships
- Nested state dependencies that could lead to synchronization issues

### Security Considerations
- Direct database write operations without permission checks
- Detailed error messages might expose implementation details
- Heavy reliance on environment variables for configuration
- Potential for path traversal issues in file hierarchy manipulation

### Browser Compatibility
- No browser-specific code; should work across modern browsers
- Complex DOM operations might behave differently across browsers
- Extensive use of modern JavaScript features might require transpilation for older browsers
