# Maintainability Assessment Guide

## Purpose
This guide provides a structured approach to evaluating code maintainability in the DHG codebase. It helps developers, reviewers, and managers consistently assess and improve code quality.

## Assessment Process

### 1. Select the Scope
Determine whether you're evaluating:
- An entire repository
- A specific module or service
- An individual file
- A function or component

### 2. Apply the Criteria
For each selected scope, assess the following dimensions:

#### Complexity (1-5)
- **Structure**: Evaluate control flow, nesting levels, and logic complexity
- **Size**: Check function/method/component size
- **Algorithms**: Consider computational complexity

#### Readability (1-5)
- **Naming**: Check if identifiers are clear and follow conventions
- **Formatting**: Evaluate adherence to style guidelines
- **Comments**: Assess quality and quantity of inline documentation
- **Architecture**: Review how intuitive the design is

#### Modularity (1-5)
- **Cohesion**: Check if components have single responsibilities
- **Coupling**: Evaluate dependencies between modules
- **Reusability**: Consider how easily components can be reused
- **Interfaces**: Review clarity of component boundaries

#### Testability (1-5)
- **Coverage**: Check existing test coverage
- **Test quality**: Evaluate how comprehensive tests are
- **Mocking**: Consider ease of isolating components for testing
- **Edge cases**: Check handling of error conditions

#### Extensibility (1-5)
- **Open/closed**: Evaluate adherence to the open/closed principle
- **Configuration**: Check how easily behavior can be configured
- **Extensibility points**: Review availability of hooks and extension points
- **Versioning**: Consider how changes affect clients

### 3. Calculate Overall Score
Average the scores across all dimensions for an overall maintainability score (1-5).

### 4. Document Findings
Record the assessment results with:
- Overall score
- Dimension scores
- Specific areas for improvement
- Examples of good practices to preserve
