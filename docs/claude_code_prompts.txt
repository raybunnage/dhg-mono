 Please verify all TypeScript code compiles without errors before
  submitting changes. Add proper types to all parameters, return
  values, and variables to avoid type errors.

 "status_recommendation": "KEEP"

 on the "AI" page when under the "Database" tab when you click "Set Relatinonships" and a dialog pops up called "Manage Prompt Relationships" down at the bottom where a text window appears under "Database Query" add a second database query text field and a second databasequery2 to the prompts metadata field table.  It turns out I need 2 queries per prompt. And of course save this second query when you save the prompt.

pnpm supabase gen types typescript --project-id jdksnfkupzywjdfefkyj > supabase/types.ts

on the "Scripts" page show the script files from the "scripts" tables in supabase on the left side in cards. For now just display them in alphabetical order and put a search text box above them and add a "Search" button that will just search the text in the script table for the titles and match the text that I type so far to filter on them.  On each card I want the file_path, the size, the created and updated date and the document_type from the document_types table based on the document_type_id on the scripts record (which has yet to be filled in.)    On the right side I want you to do something similar to the "Docs" page - first have a collapsible section on the right side where you display the summmary and status_recommendation field as well as the most important assessment fields - they will be filled in soon.  Below that i need a view window where I dispaly the .sh or .js file.  To do that I need a script that is similar to scripts/cli-pipeline/simple-md-server.js that is a simple viewer of .sh or .js files - hopefully showing the files in dark mode - I expect to run the script for this in its on command window just like I do for simple-md-view.  Finally on the top right above the summary tab can you create the "Copy Content" button and "Delete" button just like you did for me on the "Docs" page.  Thanks.

  Handling Supabase Dependencies in CLI Scripts

  The Problem

  Scripts often fail with the error: Error: Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'

  The Solution

  Follow these established patterns used in existing scripts:

  Method 1: Check and install dependencies before use

  # Check if the module is installed
  if ! npm list @supabase/supabase-js &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Installing @supabase/supabase-js..."
    npm install --no-save @supabase/supabase-js &> /dev/null
  fi

  Method 2: For Node.js scripts, include dependency check in script

  try {
    require('@supabase/supabase-js');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Installing @supabase/supabase-js...');
    require('child_process').execSync('npm install --no-save @supabase/supabase-js', {stdio:
  'inherit'});
  }

  Method 3: Create package.json in temporary directories

  # Create package.json with dependencies
  cat > "$TEMP_DIR/package.json" << 'EOL'
  {
    "name": "temp-script",
    "dependencies": {
      "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.48.1"
    }
  }
  EOL

  # Install dependencies in the temp directory
  (cd "$TEMP_DIR" && npm install --silent)

  Always follow these patterns instead of assuming dependencies are globally available.
 

future prompt:

despite trying to help you it seems getting the credential for supabaswe continues to elude yuou as you see in this current report even after I gave you some ways to fix it:

raybunnage@Rays-Laptop dhg-mono %  ./scripts/cli-pipeline/script-pipeline-main.sh generate-summary
📊 Generating summary report for 50 scripts (include deleted: false)...
Installing dependencies in temporary directory...
Executing summary report generator...

So you have suggested I could  make Supabase dependencies globally available, you would:

  1. Install the packages globally with npm/pnpm:
    - npm install -g @supabase/supabase-js
    - This makes them available system-wide
  2. Create a shared node_modules directory in the project root:
    - Install dependencies once at the top level
    - Configure NODE_PATH environment variable to include this location
  3. Set up package hoisting in the monorepo:
    - Configure pnpm or other package manager to hoist common dependencies
    - Ensure the workspace configuration properly shares packages
  4. Create a dedicated shared package:
    - Make a "common-dependencies" package in the monorepo
    - All scripts would import from this package instead of directly
  5. Implement a custom module resolution system:
    - Configure Node.js to look in specific locations for modules
    - Use symlinks or module aliases to map dependencies


​“Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources this problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move on to implementing the actual code fix.”  We want to think this trhough and we would need some tests of your apporach after you build it to make sure it works. So first thihk it thorugh carefully



 Prompt Formula:
​“Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move on to implementing the actual code fix.”

Quick Description:
​Vibe coding—using AI to create apps, games, websites, and more without extensive coding expertise—is getting more popular by the day. But even when letting AI handle the heavy lifting, things inevitably go wrong, and that’s where this prompt shines.

It's the ideal first step when you hit an unexpected snag. Instead of immediately asking the AI to rewrite or debug blindly, this prompt instructs the AI to pause, analyze the situation carefully, and pinpoint the most likely culprits. By narrowing down the issue first and strategically adding logs, you avoid wasting time and get more precise results from your AI assistant.

How to Use:

Pause when you encounter a problem in your AI-generated code.

I need you to apply the functionality of the scripts/cli-pipeline/document-manager.sh and scripts/cli-pipeline/document-pipeline-main.sh the scripts files.

We will need a new scripts/cli-pipeline/script-manager and scripts/cli-pipeline/script-pipeline-main.sh - with simnilar optiohs for finding, syncing, adding and classifying scripts just as we do markdown files.  Scripts can be .sh or .js files that have been created and exist on disk.  

I want you to reuse the packages/cli services as much as possible so we don't have to reinvent the wheel.   I want you to add new services if necessary to support the main scripts. 

I want you to write a beautiful techincal specification telling an ai engine exactly how to do this - safely - step by step. It should especially include this step you wanted me to ask you since yuou always have typescript errors after writing code:

Please verify all TypeScript code compiles without errors before
  submitting changes. Add proper types to all parameters, return
  values, and variables to avoid type errors.

It should adhere to the guidance you provided in the following document:


These are the options I want you to write the script for only it should be focused on the scripts table I gave you at the beginning.

For the prompt extraction I already have a prompt with the name:  "script-analysis-prompt" in the prompts database and you should be able to reuse the prompt_relationships code you have in the packages/cli/src/services/prompt-query-service.ts and possible the packages/cli/src/services/prompt-document-classifier.ts as well.  Write it to help it get built step by step with plenty of logging to let you know what is going on. 

Usage: scripts/cli-pipeline/document-pipeline-main.sh [option] [count]
Options:
  sync                      - Synchronize database with files on disk (mark files as deleted/not deleted)
  find-new                  - Find and insert new files on disk into the database
  show-untyped              - Show all documentation files without a document type
  show-recent               - Show the 20 most recent files based on update date
  classify-recent           - Classify the 20 most recent files
  classify-untyped [n]      - Classify untyped files, optionally specify number to process (default: 10)
  clean-script-results      - Remove script-analysis-results files from the database
  generate-summary [n] [i]  - Generate a summary report of documents
                              n: Number of documents (default: 50, use 'all' for all documents)
                              i: Include deleted (true/false, default: false)
  all                       - Run the complete pipeline (sync, find-new, classify-recent)
  help                      - Show this help message

LETS see what you can write up to guide your creation of these new scripts.




Document pipeline process complete
raybunnage@Rays-Laptop dhg-mono %  



Please verify all TypeScript code compiles without errors before

can you make the scripts/cli-pipeline/document-pipeline-main.sh script or the scripts/cli-pipeline/document-manager.sh it calls faster - perhaps by working in batches - let me know the ways you can speed it up?


now write a script that acts like a main program and calls the /scripts/cli-pipeline/document-manager.sh appropriately with the different options:

1) mark files with is_deleted = false if they exist on disk
2) mark files with is_deleted = true if they do not exist on disk
3) find new files on disk that aren't in the documnentation_files and insert the new records into the documentation_files
4) shows all the documentation_files that don't have a document_type if they exist on disk
5) shows the most 20 recent files based on updated dates 
6) passes the 20 most recent files whether they have a document_type or not and passes them off to the   ./scripts/cli-pipeline/document-manager.sh classify function with the proper file_path parameter to process them with rate limitiing in mind




with classify and passses the name of each documentation_file that is chosen


now I need a .cursor rule - if no specific path is specified for a markdown file - see if the file falls neatly into one of these document_types and 


Please verify all TypeScript code compiles without errors before
  submitting changes. Add proper types to all parameters, return
  values, and variables to avoid type errors."


  Write up a relativelyh short markdown file that I can paste in before I request you to do something. If you can reflet on the common problems you have to repeateedly fix and provide text to guide you in the future that would be helopful.

  For examople:  you gave me the following text to add to prevent typescript errors:
  "Please verify all TypeScript code compiles without errors before
  submitting changes. Add proper types to all parameters, return
  values, and variables to avoid type errors."

  Also, write up an informative short statement about each of the files that have significatn functionality in my packages/cli pipelihne approach:  here is the tree listing all the key files so far: Extensive work has gone into factoring out the key servcies, perefecting them to work properly and reusing them in differen cli pipeline commands:

Lets see what you come up with that I can feed into claude code. Write your markdown file into docs/cli-pipeline folder



Please extract the query execution logic
  from prompt-lookup.ts into a shared utility class that both the scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts and the scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts can use. Make it so this shared service is used by both since the scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts is working properlyu. 

 For now, I see that you have directly adapted the working pattern into the
  document-classification-service.ts file, ensuring it follows the
  same approach that's already working. However, can you refact it to use this shared sservice for the query that is working so I don't have such an issue debugging the code for scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts.   Thanks.
  

The best pattern would be to extract the query execution logic
  from prompt-lookup.ts into a shared utility class that both
  services can use.
  2. For now, I've directly adapted the working pattern into the
  document-classification-service.ts file, ensuring it follows the
  same approach that's already working.
  3. The main issue was that the new service wasn't applying the
  same pattern for database access that was proven to work in
  prompt-lookup.ts.

when you output the markdown files from the scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt-lookup.ts you need to write them to the folder: docs/cli-pipeline which is now designated for the markdown outputs for this script

when you output the markdown file from the scripts/cli-pipeline/script-report.sh you will need to write it into the folder: docs/cli-pipeline  



now we are interested in adding the functionality of the scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt-lookup.ts to the 
scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts script. This command proves that we can load a prompt by name and its associated file_relationships and retrieve all the information that is needed for an ai api call to claude 3.7   I need you to do all the things you can do in the scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt-lookup.ts file - but now this data will next be submitted to claude 3.7 just for these docoumentation_files that do not have a documentation type.  Again add this functionallity by first looking for existing functionalithy in packages/cli and if necessary create a new service there to assist with this progress.  Do not add all the code in the  scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts but rather import it fomr an existing (adjusted) - or new services that you create in the packages/cli. I do not want you to break scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt-lookup.ts.

for the scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts now provide a new option and create a new service under packages/cli (if the functionality doesn't exist) that will identify all the file_paths of the documentation_files that do not have a document_type assigned yet because most likely they are new or were moved to a different folder. It should display those when the new option is chosen like it does the others. Keep the other functionatliy intact and if necessary create a new dedicated service for this functionality


on the "Scripts" page on the first tab on tne left side provide command: scripts/cli-pipeline/display-doc-paths.ts and a button to run it.  On the right side provide an interactive terminal window for it to be launched in and to watch its progress. Can you do this?

Now write a new script and put it into the packages/cli-pipeline Category

0) make it compatible with the cli pipeline approach
1) it should use the existing services in the packages/cli folder and beneath as much as possible.
2) if a new service is needed then it should create and use that services
3) it needs to search on disk for all markdown files - but it should exclude any it finds in file_types folder or backup or archive or external tools folders
4) if it finds a new markdown file that is not in the documentation_files it needs to add it to the documentation_files and set is_deleted = FALSE
5) if it no longer finds a markdown file it needs to mark that record in documentation_files as is_deleted = TRUE
6) It needs to update the metadata for each file it finds and put that into the metadata fields in the documentation_files
7) It needs to write the full path of the markdown file for any file it finds on disk - if a relative path is found overwrite it with the full_path - we need to count on it




The script should now run properly without TypeScript errors. I've made
   these improvements:

  1. Created a simplified SimpleSupabaseService class that only
  implements the methods we need
  2. Fixed the TypeScript errors related to the property access
  3. Improved the error handling in the database query execution

  Try running it again with:

  ./scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt-lookup.sh script-analysis-prompt

  It should now be able to:
  1. Look up the prompt by name in the database
  2. Show all of its relationships and context
  3. Display the content of the prompt file from disk
  4. Execute any database queries specified in the metadata



now using the packages/cli pipeline services write code that will take the name of a prompt file in the prompts database - return the content of the prompts table, then find the id of the prompt file and use that to find the correct prompt_relationships and extract out the context of the relationships as well as read and load the file from disk, also, take the metadata from the prompt file and if it has a database query - execute that query and retrieve the results in json format - and dispaly that as well.  Provide a new script in the scripts/cli-pipeline to perform these operations - just given a prompt name to lookup.  




on the "Ai" page under "Databawe" tab when you press "Set Relationships" a dialog box comes up. On the right of the dialog is a list of files called "Related Documentation Files". Keep the list of markdown files that appears when you select a prompt, but now "Append" a list of all package.json files across my project and add it to the list of files you can choose under "Relationship Settings". Also let the "Search" right above this list look for the package.json files as well.

Remove the "Test Docs" tab and the associated functions (as long as they are not used elsewhere. Nonetheless i don't want the "Test Docs" code anymore and I'm concenred about any duplicate cocd you might have because of it.

Now on the left side on the "Docs" page below the 4 buttons - but above the list of documentation_files, can you find all the "tags" that are auto-generated and in the Documentaion_files records and for all files where "is_deleted" = false, create "Pills" from the tags and display either a pill for each "tag"  or for the tags that have the highest number in the documentation_files table and then make the pills become filters for the documentation files - according to the chosen tag(s)



Now on the "Docs" page there are 3 buttons
on the upper left
1) on the "Search" button - now can you use the metadata in the documentation_files to search in addition to the other strategies you had before
2) the "Sync Database" button need to be connected now to the scripts/markdown-report.sh script 
3) the "Run Report & Sync" needs to changed to "Update Docs" and drive the dhg-mono/apps/dhg-improve-experts/scripts/update-docs-database.sh script
4) a new button called "Process AI" needs to call the new cli pipeline script called 
./process-docs-batch.sh --all --limit 20 in the apps/dhg-improve_experts project in my mono repo
5) add the status_recommendation to the meta data for each documentation file
6) on the right side of the "Docs" page where there is a markdown viewer right above it is an expandable/collapsable "Summary" from the documentatin_files summary field.  Right now it is raw json, can you format it with pretty JSON (and remove "brief" from the display of this)





I have run into rate limiting issues from the claude api calls, so here is a spec to implement to address.  Now that my first batch mostly worked, when you integrate this technical spec for rate limitiing, can you also tweak my existing code to skip reprocessing if the document_type_id is not null and the assessment reocrds are filled in for an existing record in the documentation_files - no need repeating what has already been successfully done is the principle I want you to implment

Here is the techincal spec:


# Technical Specification: Rate Limiting for Claude API Calls

## Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for implementing rate limiting in the documentation analysis pipeline to prevent exceeding Anthropic's API rate limits while preserving the multi-threaded architecture.

## Problem Statement

The current implementation processes multiple files in parallel, which efficiently utilizes system resources but quickly exceeds Anthropic's Claude API rate limits. This causes API requests to fail with rate limit errors, preventing the successful processing of large batches of files.

Anthropic typically enforces the following limits:
- Requests per minute (RPM) limits (typically 5-15 RPM for most tiers)
- Tokens per minute (TPM) limits
- Concurrent request limits

## Requirements

1. **Preserve Multi-threading**: Maintain the existing multi-threaded architecture
2. **Comply with Rate Limits**: Ensure API calls don't exceed Anthropic's limits
3. **Minimal Changes**: Implement with minimal modifications to the existing codebase
4. **Transparency**: Provide visibility into rate limiting status
5. **Configurability**: Allow easy adjustment of rate limiting parameters

## Proposed Solution

Implement a token bucket rate limiter that will control the flow of requests to the Claude API while allowing the rest of the processing pipeline to continue operating in parallel.

### 1. Rate Limiter Implementation

Create a `RateLimiter` class that implements the token bucket algorithm:

```typescript
// src/utils/rate-limiter.ts
export class RateLimiter {
  private tokens: number;
  private maxTokens: number;
  private refillRate: number; // tokens per second
  private lastRefillTimestamp: number;
  private queue: Array<() => void> = [];
  private processing = false;

  constructor(maxTokens: number, refillRate: number) {
    this.tokens = maxTokens;
    this.maxTokens = maxTokens;
    this.refillRate = refillRate;
    this.lastRefillTimestamp = Date.now();
  }

  private refillTokens(): void {
    const now = Date.now();
    const timePassed = (now - this.lastRefillTimestamp) / 1000; // in seconds
    const tokensToAdd = timePassed * this.refillRate;
    
    this.tokens = Math.min(this.maxTokens, this.tokens + tokensToAdd);
    this.lastRefillTimestamp = now;
  }

  async acquire(cost = 1): Promise<void> {
    this.refillTokens();
    
    if (this.tokens >= cost) {
      this.tokens -= cost;
      return Promise.resolve();
    }
    
    // If not enough tokens, wait in queue
    return new Promise<void>(resolve => {
      this.queue.push(() => {
        this.tokens -= cost;
        resolve();
      });
      
      if (!this.processing) {
        this.processQueue();
      }
    });
  }

  private async processQueue(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.queue.length === 0) {
      this.processing = false;
      return;
    }
    
    this.processing = true;
    
    // Wait until we have at least one token
    while (this.tokens < 1) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
      this.refillTokens();
    }
    
    // Process next item in queue
    const next = this.queue.shift();
    if (next) {
      next();
    }
    
    // Continue processing queue
    setTimeout(() => this.processQueue(), 50);
  }
}

// Create a singleton instance for Claude API
export const claudeRateLimiter = new RateLimiter(
  3,     // max tokens (requests) - allow bursts of up to 3 requests
  0.167  // refill rate (requests per second) - 10 requests per minute
);
```

### 2. Integration with Claude Service

Modify the Claude service to use the rate limiter before making API calls:

```typescript
// src/services/claude-service.ts
import { claudeRateLimiter } from '../utils/rate-limiter';
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';

export class ClaudeService {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  async callClaudeApi(request: ClaudeRequest): Promise<ClaudeResponse> {
    try {
      // Wait for rate limiter to allow the request
      await claudeRateLimiter.acquire(1);
      
      logger.debug(`Calling Claude API with model: ${request.model}`);
      
      // ... existing API call code ...
      
    } catch (error) {
      // ... existing error handling ...
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Configuration

Add rate limiting configuration to the application settings:

```typescript
// src/utils/config.ts
export default {
  // ... existing config ...
  
  rateLimits: {
    claude: {
      maxTokens: 3,           // Maximum burst capacity
      refillRate: 0.167,      // Tokens per second (10 per minute)
      enabled: true           // Enable/disable rate limiting
    }
  }
};
```

Update the rate limiter initialization to use these settings:

```typescript
// src/utils/rate-limiter.ts
import config from './config';

// Create a singleton instance for Claude API
export const claudeRateLimiter = new RateLimiter(
  config.rateLimits.claude.maxTokens,
  config.rateLimits.claude.refillRate
);
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Rate Limiter

1. Create the `RateLimiter` class in `src/utils/rate-limiter.ts`
2. Add rate limiting configuration to `src/utils/config.ts`
3. Create the singleton `claudeRateLimiter` instance

### Phase 2: Claude Service Integration

1. Modify the `callClaudeApi` method in `ClaudeService` to use the rate limiter
2. Add appropriate logging for rate limiting events

### Phase 3: Testing

1. Test with small batches to verify rate limiting works
2. Monitor API responses for rate limit errors
3. Adjust rate limiting parameters if needed

## Usage

The rate limiter is transparent to the rest of the application. The only change in usage is that API calls may take longer to complete due to rate limiting.

Example of how the rate limiter affects the code flow:

```typescript
// Before rate limiting
async function processFile(file) {
  const result = await claudeService.classifyDocument(file.content);
  // Process result...
}

// After rate limiting (no change to this function)
async function processFile(file) {
  const result = await claudeService.classifyDocument(file.content);
  // Process result...
}

// The rate limiting happens inside the claudeService.classifyDocument method
```

## Rate Limit Parameter Calculation

To calculate appropriate rate limiting parameters:

1. **For RPM limits**:
   - If limit is 10 RPM: `refillRate = 10/60 = 0.167` tokens per second
   - `maxTokens` should be set to allow reasonable bursts (2-3 is typical)

2. **For TPM limits**:
   - Calculate average tokens per request
   - Adjust `cost` parameter in `acquire()` based on estimated token usage

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

1. **Preserves Multi-threading**: The architecture remains multi-threaded, only the Claude API calls are throttled
2. **Minimal Changes**: Only requires adding a rate limiter and modifying the API call function
3. **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts to different rate limits by changing parameters
4. **Efficient**: Uses a token bucket algorithm that allows for bursts while maintaining average limits

### Cons

1. **Increased Processing Time**: Overall processing will take longer due to rate limiting
2. **Memory Usage**: Queued requests remain in memory while waiting
3. **Complexity**: Adds another layer to the architecture



## Conclusion

This rate limiting implementation provides a solution that:

1. Preserves the multi-threaded architecture of the existing pipeline
2. Ensures compliance with Anthropic's API rate limits
3. Requires minimal changes to the existing codebase
4. Can be easily configured to adapt to different rate limit requirements

By implementing this solution, the documentation analysis pipeline will be able to process large batches of files without encountering rate limit errors, while still maintaining the efficiency benefits of parallel processing for other operations.

now write me a markdown file in the docs folder off the root that explains everthing about this cli pipeline works, use this current command that I call with pnpm run cli:workflow:execute but is actually running the ./scripts/run-workflow.sh --execute works.  How will I use this pipeline for other "recipe" based pipelines without messing up this one. If I want to pararmaterize the scipt that I have now I would - have a parameter passing the filename of the source file to analyze - and then it would find the corresponding file ih the documentation_files table and do the update after calling the api.  Also, can you describe eacdh of the components that it uses because I think they are the servidces i will be using again and againg in other recipes. Explain it to me.  And if possible put these insturctions into the documjentation so I will know what I requested. 

I have sophisticated set of processing I need - here's an example: I have added logic from another script to this classify script.  It will be doing some complicated functions in the ndoe sectionl.  Herre is what needs to happen.  and rearrange the code in the script to accompoish thest steps


NOw that I have this platform built  for me I need to start using it. here is the start of my workflow:

1) open up the target markdown file: docs/markdown-report.md. right now this is hardcoded but evetn9ually this will represent any markdown file that needs to be examimed.
2) next open up the supabase table in prompts databse table that has the name: "markdown-document-classification-prompt" retrieve the id and then return the content field and then query for the same the id in the file "prompt_relationships" and find the associated records.  Read out the "asset_path" field of each of these records and open and read the content of those two files. Also, retreiver the "context" field from those records.  
Let's start with just this much. HOw do I get started with just these steps?

Here's additional steps to add to the worflow after these firsst (that I want you to keep)

1) do a searcdh of the document_types table for all the records that have the category "Documentation" and get those records into json format.
2) finally you need to assemple the text for a  proper ai api call to claude sonnet 3.7 you will be using the model:  claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 and the following that I found in A
successufl call to an eearlier validatin script: 
 const options = {
        hostname: 'api.anthropic.com',
        port: 443,
        path: '/v1/messages',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'x-api-key': anthropicApiKey,
          'anthropic-version': '2023-06-01',
          'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(data)
        }
      };


3) submit the markdown example file you successfully read eearlier as the main file to be analyzed in the ai call
4) assemble a prompt using the "content" field from step 2 - that is the actual; prompt you will be analyzing the file with 
5)) add the following context to the ai prompt that it will need to evaluate the target file
a) the results of step earlier in your workflow proces - the json from the matching document_type records that have the category "Documentation"
b) the two files that were the related files in th prompt_relationships table - you will need to read them from disk and load them - along with the "conterxt" fields that go with them.
Can you show that you have all the ingredients for the ai api call.


Now add this final step to the workflow: take the api results that are in json and update the assessment fields of the matching record for the file you analyzed: "docs/markdown-report.md" and then show the json from this record that shows that the assesssement fields got filled in properly after you've updated the record and can pull the assessement information from the updated record in the database




6) Then you will need to esecute the ai dcall and write the response that you get back in the json format that was submitted to the ai.
I would like to see confirmation that these steps occured in the final report that you generate in the markdown file: docs\markdown-classifation-report.md and I would like to see the json from the response shown in the report so I can know the api call worked.

My approach so far has been to create a shell scrtipt (sh) which then calls out to node to implement the ai api calls, the database calls and to process things.  I hve the main script embed this code in itl. 

My question is - how best should I handle this
I am thinking I could break it down into smaller diescrte scripts or steps and perhaps even have a dedicated script for each which I could then perfect and chain together somehow.  These scripts might perform different sfunctions  such as read a specific file, retrieve json data from a certain database table with a specifid query, combine data together for a an api call to the ai, format the response data from the ai - to name a few.  I also think maybe some of this could be written in python.  What are the pros and cons of scripts (sh), .js scripts, front end react typescript and even python.  Of course in the end the script (or scripts) will be called by my ui front end react functionsk, but IIm oving away from having all the functi0ons in react and putting them in scripts for these routine operationts that will be doing some sophistacted functioning.  How do you make sense of all these options.  What are some approaches and their pros and cons.  What would you recommend?











now in addition to what you have already add this:
1) find the prompt in the "prompts" table that matches the name: "markdown-document-classification-prompt" then read out the contents of the prompt and display it.   
2)you found the proper id from the relationshiip table and even though it say "Undefeind" next to Document Type in your report this is indeed the id of the docuement_type record you want to query to retireve the associated document_type for display.  You are almost thhere
3) for the 7 records you found in document_types that had the specified cateogry "Documenation" I really need the json for each of these records brought into the report because when we apply this to the projmopmt we have to have this in JSON form.  Can you do all of these properly?

on the "Ai" page under "Database" when you press "Set Relationips" a dialog box cones up. Remove the following fields o that dialog that apply generally to all relationships and instead move the following fields on to the individal cards that are checked just as you did for document types. so now we'll need to add these fields on the dialog box that are under "Default Relationship Settings" to individual cards. They are - a drop down for "Reference Type", an edit box for "Context" and a "Description field".  You will need to move these to eadch card which means the card will need to be bigger to accomodate them. I think that the ui should remember the settings that users make to each of these fields on the iundividual cards, but only when "Save Relationships" button is pressed should these savings for each invidiaul checked prompt_relationship record be collectively saved.  If they don't click the "Save Relationshiops" button and press "Cancel" instead they will lose the changes they made. Lets try this


on the "supabase" page under "Tables & views" there are some buttons on the right towards the bottom. Add another text box for me to input an id field and then a button I can press that will search for thaat records and show me the json if it it finds a match in the currently chosen table.  Display that json in the json window below so I can see what the record looks

You did a great job so far with this relationships dialog but I see a few problems:
1) you offer the docoument types, the description and the context field as well as the list of files to relate to the original prompt.  But for each related file I need to be able to set the these fields independently but when I save it applies to whatever files are checked and then I have the same information in all the related recordds in the prompt_relatsionship tables. I need you to let me set these properties for each related file. Another problem is that when I hit edit relationships only the default information in the prompt_relationshiops fioes shows up rather than the saved data that is in the prompt_relationships table. the third problem is that when I seledct the dropdown on the left under "Select a Prompt" I don't see the related files being shown.  in fact it is not showing the relationships because even after I select the file that has relationships it says "No related files for this prompt". Also when you do show them I need the context field and documnent_type field to show up on the list so I can review my instructions.  You can tackle these one at a time.


Again lets add_soft_delete_to_docs one more set of funcionality to the "Set Relationships" on the "Ai" page under the "Database" tab.  I just identified another field called document_type_id on the table "prompt_relationships" table.  I need you to modify the ui to accomodate this new field as a dropdown wherer the user can associate the document_type_id of the related asset as well as the actual markdown file to choose from. Of course it should successfully save the relationship information with all its new fields that we are allowing the user to add.  



now lets one more set of funcionality to the "Set Relationships" on the "Ai" page under the "Database" tab.  Now that the following fields now exist on the "prompt_relationships" table I need you to modify the ui to accomodate the fields I should be filling in such as relationship_context field any any others you deem necessary

on the "Ai" page under the "Database" tab - can you add lower down on the page a new button that says: "Set Relationships" that does nothing yet - 


on the "Ai" page under the "Database" tab  now hook up code to "Set Relationships" that allows you to pick one of the prompts and assign the other asset types which will mostly be markdown files that are listed in documentation_files that are actually support the main prompt that are seleced. They are usually mentioned as being support assets in the original prompt stored in the "prompts" table.  You need to query the documentation_files table for existing records only that will provide a list of markdown files - I guess if you also provide the date (and soon the document_type when I have hooked up and sort in descdeing order I can find the file I want for the relationship in a flat list - to start with.  Implement just that much functionalithy in the front end code )


THe problem is I need to load one or markdown files which are local to my machihne. Can you give me a script that I can run to load the actual markdown file that you can call on the front end and which will give you its contents to pass to the ai.  THe problem with the relatioships table is that i want to specify the relationsshiopts of these asset files to the original prompt so I can provide the necessary context.  But unlike the prompts these are dynamic files whose content may change.  I suppose as long as the name of the asset doesn['t change  - even it its content does, the relatshionsip table just needs to define the fixed loation and as long as the script you build can take a filepath and read the conents of the file and provide to the front end, the relatiohship tables will be useful because it shows what the prompt needs to do its work and it will be in the database so it will make it easier to build soiphistacted multi file contest file prompts to submit to the ai.

undereath the "supabase" page under the "Sql Editor" tab hook up the real code to run the sql query (you had done this once    │
│   before).  Make sure the code to save the query is provided once it    │
│   runs successfully - it was all working beautifully but you turned if  │
│   off for some reason.  You even had it so when I saved the query it came up with a way to state what it was used for. Is that functionality still there?


Info about restoring a previous version
91272de is the commit I need for restoring the script
file path: scripts/markdown-report.sh

Ok - we're trying a different approach to a prompt that generates sql.  For the time being create a new page called "Test Sql" and write entirely new code that implements ui that 1) has a multiline text input box where the user prompt is added  2) a button to take that promopt and call claude sonnet 3.7 with the data from the user and applying the "supabase-sql-query-guide" from the prompts table and then having a json window wherfe the results are written.  Using the logic defined in this following spec defining similar code functionality





find the word "Category" or "Categories" in the code and give me a        │
│   markdown file showing me all the instances and the code   │
│   involved that has "Category" so that I can direct you in  │
│   the future to safely change this to another word than     │
│   category.


Lets take a different approach.  add a new page called "Test Docs"

Here is the code from a script that corectly identifies all the markdown files in my project

the path of this script is: scripts/markdown-report.sh

Write a new script - using the same search logic that will update the table: 

[
  {
    "column_name": "id",
    "data_type": "string",
    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "0b6f230f-8fa8-4a72-9d0d-9e6d34ff6376"

    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",

  },
  {

    "data_type": "object",
    "is_nullable": "YES",

    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "2025-03-02T12:06:00+00:00"
  },
  {
    "column_name": "last_indexed_at",
    "data_type": "string",

    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "2025-03-08T02:12:36.861+00:00"
  },
  {
    "column_name": "file_hash",
    "data_type": "string",
    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "445a2ec2-19573869cf6"
  },
  {
    "column_name": "metadata",
    "data_type": "object",
    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "{\"size\":3222,\"isPrompt\":false}"
  },
  {
    "column_name": "created_at",
    "data_type": "string",
    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "2025-03-03T10:29:53.982723+00:00"
  },
  {
    "column_name": "updated_at",
    "data_type": "string",
    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "2025-03-08T02:12:37.010808+00:00"
  },
  {
    "column_name": "is_deleted",
    "data_type": "boolean",
    "is_nullable": "YES",
    "table_name": "documentation_files",
    "table_schema": "public",
    "sample_value": "true"
  }
]

I noticed that when I check the table all the records were marked as is_deleted = true. that should not be.  when you are done, the files for certain records will have been moved and they won't exist.  Mark only those with is_deleted = true. But new and existing files that you find need to hve their metadata updated and new records created, so the script will be more invovled.  Basically the idea is to have the script interact with the database on the documentation_files and the end result is that that table should faithfully identify the status of all files in my project on disk.  







on the "Supabsae" page 
under the "Tables & Views" tab
on the right side of the page there is a label called "app_pages" - change that to "Column Names"
add a button further below on the right below the  "Column Names" that says "Show Records" and has a small edit box with the number 3 as default in it.  Right below that are a couple of pills to click. The first pill is "Show xxx_at fields" - the default is to not show these "at" fields.  In a window below show the JSON for the number of records specified in the box at the time the user presses them.  This will give them some indication of how the fields are populated in a table that has redcords.



on the "Supabase" page under the "Sql Editor" add a button to the right of "Save Query" called "Ask Ai" and when this button is pressed provide ui to enter in a multi line edit box a requests for help  from the AI to generate sql to accomplish some purpose in the database.  Make the sure the sql you provide for the request will work correctly and then copy it into the SQL query window so the user can test it. Just provide the ui for the moment. I will create a prompt for this and load it into the "prompts" table so soon you can load up the real thing and we can test it out.


 
 
 Currentlh the "Supabase" page functionality is awesome but I notice that it refreshes each tab whenever I switch tabs.  I assume this is the expecdted behaviour but it becomes kind of annoying as everytime I swtich tabs I have to wait for it to refresh again, which is quite a few seconds.  It would bve usaeful if you could cache the results after the first search and then when I return to a page used the cacheed results.  Then if I knew there where changes to the databawes and I wanted the ui t pick them up - I would have some ui mechanism to refresh - clear the previous cache and pickup the new changes.  What do you suggest?

Using ther logicv of the script above together with the output of the files that you should find
use these both to reviese your code 

here are the felds in the documentation_files
currently it says it has 96 files in the documentation_files table but the report shows 89 files. I am pretty sure some of the record need to be marked as soft_delete because they have been moved on disk.

I need the "Sync Database" button on the "Docs" page to ACCURATELY find the markdown files on disk across all the folders in my mono project repostitory - the root path of the mono repo project is at  dhg-mono  - you should use the same search logic that the script is using to finhd the same files and to accurately update the documentation_files accordinly, as my markdown viewer depends on the file existing and the path being correct. 

Please get it right as I will have to give you another way to apporach this. The answeer lies in mimicing the recursive searching that is in the sceript I shared with you



 
 
 
 
 some of the files shown in the "Document Files" tree under the "Docs"      │
│   page do not exist either on disk or in the documentation_files table as    │
│   far as I can tell.  One that that won't read (and thus probably doesn't    │
│   exist is: docs/ai-processing/function-analysis.md  - can you find out how  │
│   this file is getting into the "Document Files" tree and how it even        │
│   shows up if it is not in the documentation_files table.  THe "Document     │
│   Files" tree should only be getting its files from the documenation_files   │
│   table - no where else and if a file no longer exists it should be marked   │
│   with a soft delete flat and NOT shown in the tree. Please investigate   
 
 node simple-md-server.js

Now that the script: scripts/markdown-report.sh
 is working well to find all the markdown files on disk and to extract their metadata I need you to make a new "Sync" database button on the "Docs" page as the previous "Sync Database" button is not working properly.

Basically what needs to happen is that the database table I have below when you query it is not being updated properly. I need you to keep this table up to date with the actual files that are on disk.  If you need to refer to the script: scripts/markdown-report.sh to do so great.  If you need to create a new script that you can call or that will run on disk, then do so since this only needs to work on my development machine for now.


if there is not a soft delete on the table I need you to give me the sql to alter the table to add it and then if you can't find a previous documentation_file I need you to soft delete it for now, so that the the documentation_files have another script which will read the records (that are not soft deleted and display them properly in a markdown viewer.  The bottom line is that the documentation_files have to be up-to-date.

the script: docs/markdown-report.md is awesome. But recently I moved some markdown files to the root directlory under a new folder called prompts.  Can you modify the script carefully so as to not break its functionality yet add the search for markdown files in the "prompts" directoruy off the root to complete the inventory of prompts.


On the "Supabase" page under the "Sql Editor" tab I have a functional sql query window I can execute queries from.  

Now I have created some new tables for sql query hisory using this sql:
-- Main Query History Table
CREATE TABLE sql_query_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    query_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    query_name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[], -- Array of string tags for quick access
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    execution_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_executed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    is_favorite BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    execution_status TEXT -- 'success', 'error', etc.
);

-- Tags Table
CREATE TABLE sql_query_tags (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tag_name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Junction Table for Many-to-Many Relationship
CREATE TABLE sql_query_tag_mappings (
    query_id UUID REFERENCES sql_query_history(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tag_id UUID REFERENCES sql_query_tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (query_id, tag_id)
);

-- Indexes for sql_query_history
CREATE INDEX idx_query_history_created_by ON sql_query_history(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_query_history_created_at ON sql_query_history(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_query_history_is_favorite ON sql_query_history(is_favorite);
CREATE INDEX idx_query_history_last_executed ON sql_query_history(last_executed_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_query_history_tags ON sql_query_history USING GIN(tags); -- For array of tags

-- Full text search index for query text and name
CREATE INDEX idx_query_history_text_search ON sql_query_history 
    USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', query_text || ' ' || COALESCE(query_name, '')));

-- Index for tag junction table
CREATE INDEX idx_tag_mappings_query_id ON sql_query_tag_mappings(query_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tag_mappings_tag_id ON sql_query_tag_mappings(tag_id);

-- Index for tag names
CREATE INDEX idx_tag_name ON sql_query_tags(tag_name);

And I have an ai generated spec which you follow (if it makes sense) to help implement management of this history which I have here:

# React Implementation Plan for SQL Query History System

## Overview
This document outlines the React implementation plan for integrating a SQL query history system with tagging capabilities into your frontend application. We'll focus on component architecture, state management, and AI integration.

## Core Components

### 1. QueryList Component
Main component for displaying the history of saved queries with filtering capabilities.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useQueryHistory } from '../../hooks/useQueryHistory';
import { useTags } from '../../hooks/useTags';
import QueryDetail from './QueryDetail';
import TagCloud from './TagCloud';

const QueryList = () => {
  const [selectedTags, setSelectedTags] = useState([]);
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('last_executed');
  const [selectedQuery, setSelectedQuery] = useState(null);
  
  const { queries, loading, fetchQueries } = useQueryHistory();
  const { tags } = useTags();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchQueries({ 
      tags: selectedTags, 
      searchTerm, 
      sortBy 
    });
  }, [selectedTags, searchTerm, sortBy]);
  
  // Filter, sort, and rendering logic
  
  return (
    <div className="query-history-container">
      <div className="filters">
        <SearchInput 
          value={searchTerm} 
          onChange={setSearchTerm} 
          placeholder="Search queries..." 
        />
        <TagCloud 
          tags={tags} 
          selectedTags={selectedTags} 
          onTagSelect={tag => setSelectedTags([...selectedTags, tag])}
          onTagRemove={tag => setSelectedTags(selectedTags.filter(t => t !== tag))}
        />
        <SortSelector value={sortBy} onChange={setSortBy} />
      </div>
      
      <div className="query-list">
        {loading ? (
          <Spinner />
        ) : (
          queries.map(query => (
            <QueryListItem 
              key={query.id}
              query={query}
              isSelected={selectedQuery?.id === query.id}
              onClick={() => setSelectedQuery(query)}
            />
          ))
        )}
      </div>
      
      {selectedQuery && (
        <QueryDetail 
          query={selectedQuery}
          onClose={() => setSelectedQuery(null)} 
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 2. QueryEditor Component

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useAIAnalysis } from '../../hooks/useAIAnalysis';
import { useQueryHistory } from '../../hooks/useQueryHistory';
import CodeEditor from '../common/CodeEditor';
import TagSelector from './TagSelector';

const QueryEditor = ({ initialQuery = null }) => {
  const [queryText, setQueryText] = useState(initialQuery?.query_text || '');
  const [queryName, setQueryName] = useState(initialQuery?.query_name || '');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState(initialQuery?.description || '');
  const [tags, setTags] = useState(initialQuery?.tags || []);
  
  const { saveQuery, updateQuery } = useQueryHistory();
  const { 
    analyzeQuery, 
    suggestName, 
    suggestDescription, 
    suggestTags, 
    loading: aiLoading 
  } = useAIAnalysis();
  
  const handleAnalyzeWithAI = async () => {
    if (!queryText.trim()) return;
    
    const analysis = await analyzeQuery(queryText);
    if (analysis) {
      setQueryName(prev => prev || analysis.name);
      setDescription(prev => prev || analysis.description);
      setTags(prev => [...new Set([...prev, ...analysis.tags])]);
    }
  };
  
  const handleSave = async () => {
    if (!queryText.trim()) return;
    
    const queryData = {
      query_text: queryText,
      query_name: queryName,
      description,
      tags
    };
    
    if (initialQuery) {
      await updateQuery(initialQuery.id, queryData);
    } else {
      await saveQuery(queryData);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="query-editor">
      <div className="editor-header">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={queryName}
          onChange={e => setQueryName(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Query Name"
        />
        <Button 
          onClick={handleAnalyzeWithAI} 
          disabled={!queryText.trim() || aiLoading}
        >
          {aiLoading ? 'Analyzing...' : 'Analyze with AI'}
        </Button>
      </div>
      
      <CodeEditor
        value={queryText}
        onChange={setQueryText}
        language="sql"
      />
      
      <textarea
        value={description}
        onChange={e => setDescription(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Description"
      />
      
      <TagSelector
        selectedTags={tags}
        onTagsChange={setTags}
      />
      
      <div className="editor-actions">
        <Button onClick={handleSave}>
          {initialQuery ? 'Update Query' : 'Save Query'}
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 3. TagSelector Component
Reusable component for selecting and managing tags.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useTags } from '../../hooks/useTags';

const TagSelector = ({ selectedTags = [], onTagsChange }) => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);
  
  const { tags, createTag } = useTags();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (input.trim()) {
      const filtered = tags
        .filter(tag => 
          tag.toLowerCase().includes(input.toLowerCase()) && 
          !selectedTags.includes(tag)
        )
        .slice(0, 5);
      setSuggestions(filtered);
    } else {
      setSuggestions([]);
    }
  }, [input, tags, selectedTags]);
  
  const handleAddTag = async (tag) => {
    if (!tag.trim() || selectedTags.includes(tag)) return;
    
    // If it's a new tag, create it
    if (!tags.includes(tag)) {
      await createTag(tag);
    }
    
    onTagsChange([...selectedTags, tag]);
    setInput('');
  };
  
  const handleRemoveTag = (tag) => {
    onTagsChange(selectedTags.filter(t => t !== tag));
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="tag-selector">
      <div className="selected-tags">
        {selectedTags.map(tag => (
          <div key={tag} className="tag">
            {tag}
            <button onClick={() => handleRemoveTag(tag)}>×</button>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      
      <div className="tag-input-container">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={input}
          onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Add tags..."
          onKeyDown={e => {
            if (e.key === 'Enter' && input.trim()) {
              handleAddTag(input);
              e.preventDefault();
            }
          }}
        />
        
        {suggestions.length > 0 && (
          <ul className="tag-suggestions">
            {suggestions.map(tag => (
              <li 
                key={tag} 
                onClick={() => handleAddTag(tag)}
              >
                {tag}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  }, []);
  
  return {
    loading,
    error,
    analyzeQuery,
    suggestName,
    suggestDescription,
    suggestTags
  };
};
```

## Service Layer

### 1. queryHistoryService.js
Service for interacting with the backend API for query operations.

```javascript
import { api } from './api';

export const queryHistoryService = {
  fetchQueries: async (filters = {}) => {
    const { 
      tags = [], 
      searchTerm = '', 
      sortBy = 'created_at',
      page = 1,
      pageSize = 20
    } = filters;
    
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    if (searchTerm) params.append('search', searchTerm);
    if (sortBy) params.append('sort_by', sortBy);
    params.append('page', page.toString());
    params.append('page_size', pageSize.toString());
    
    tags.forEach(tag => params.append('tags[]', tag));
    
    const response = await api.get(`/query-history?${params.toString()}`);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  getQueryById: async (queryId) => {
    const response = await api.get(`/query-history/${queryId}`);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  saveQuery: async (queryData) => {
    const response = await api.post('/query-history', queryData);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  updateQuery: async (queryId, queryData) => {
    const response = await api.put(`/query-history/${queryId}`, queryData);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  deleteQuery: async (queryId) => {
    await api.delete(`/query-history/${queryId}`);
    return { id: queryId };
  },
  
  toggleFavorite: async (queryId) => {
    const response = await api.post(`/query-history/${queryId}/toggle-favorite`);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  incrementExecution: async (queryId, status) => {
    const response = await api.post(`/query-history/${queryId}/increment-execution`, { status });
    return response.data;
  }
};
```

### 2. aiService.js
Service for interacting with AI models for query analysis.

```javascript
import { api } from './api';

export const aiService = {
  analyzeQuery: async (queryText) => {
    const response = await api.post('/ai/analyze-query', { queryText });
    return response.data;
  },
  
  suggestName: async (queryText) => {
    const response = await api.post('/ai/suggest-name', { queryText });
    return response.data;

  },
  
  suggestTags: async (queryText) => {
    const response = await api.post('/ai/suggest-tags', { queryText });
    return response.data;
  }
};
```

## Redux Store

### queryHistorySlice.js
Redux slice for managing query history state.

```javascript
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { queryHistoryService } from '../services/queryHistoryService';

export const fetchQueriesAsync = createAsyncThunk(
  'queryHistory/fetchQueries',
  async (filters) => {
    return await queryHistoryService.fetchQueries(filters);
  }
);

export const saveQueryAsync = createAsyncThunk(
  'queryHistory/saveQuery',
  async (queryData) => {
    return await queryHistoryService.saveQuery(queryData);
  }
);

// Additional async thunks for other operations

const queryHistorySlice = createSlice({
  name: 'queryHistory',
  initialState: {
    queries: [],
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    currentQuery: null
  },
  reducers: {
    setCurrentQuery: (state, action) => {
      state.currentQuery = action.payload;
    }
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchQueriesAsync.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true;
      })
      .addCase(fetchQueriesAsync.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.queries = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchQueriesAsync.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.error = action.error.message;
      })
      // Additional cases for other async operations
  }
});

export const { setCurrentQuery } = queryHistorySlice.actions;
export default queryHistorySlice.reducer;
```

## AI Integration Implementation

### AI Integration for Query Analysis
Create a component to handle AI-powered query analysis:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useAIAnalysis } from '../../hooks/useAIAnalysis';

const AIAnalysisPanel = ({ queryText, onApplySuggestions }) => {
  const [analyzing, setAnalyzing] = useState(false);
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState(null);
  
  const { analyzeQuery } = useAIAnalysis();
  
  const handleAnalyze = async () => {
    setAnalyzing(true);
    
    try {
      const results = await analyzeQuery(queryText);
      setSuggestions(results);
    } catch (error) {

On the "Supabase Page" under the "Sql Editor" tab you have ui that lets you run  queries in sql.  I need you to first suggest database table/s that would support creating a history of queries, so after a successful query I could "archive" it (not the results) and then rerun it in the future.  I will also probably add a ui prompt that I will pass the sql to that will summarize its purpose and suggest tags for searching I could possibly use as "tags" for filtering previous prompts to find prompts I used before.

CREATE TABLE sql_query_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    query_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    query_name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[], -- Array of string tags
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    execution_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_executed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    is_favorite BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    execution_status TEXT -- 'success', 'error', etc.
  );

  Related Tables for Advanced Features

  If you want more advanced organization, you might consider these
  additional tables:

  -- For organizing tags in a more structured way
  CREATE TABLE sql_query_tags (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tag_name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
  );

  -- Junction table for many-to-many relationship between queries and tags
  CREATE TABLE sql_query_tag_mappings (
    query_id UUID REFERENCES sql_query_history(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tag_id UUID REFERENCES sql_query_tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (query_id, tag_id)
  );






now on the "Supabase" page the basic dashboard elements mostly show 0, so somehow you are not able to query the database about the tables and objects there. Please fix





Now if you haven't already hook up the code in the "Proposed Document Type Definition:" text area and take the json (which may have been edited - and first check that it is ready for the database insertion inot document_types - if it is not formatted properly then tell the user what is wrong with the formatting, but if all is well insert the record into the database if it does not yet exist and if it does exist - actually check first it does exist and refuse to insert it, but if all is well inser the record into the document_types table

on on the "Ai" page under the tabs
make a new tab that implements this plan for adding prompts into the database that is called "Database" this is the where the ui for this spec should go.  Follow the spec if it makes sense, but also veer from it if you see a better way.  I already have a file to load for my first prompt

# Prompt Management System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a robust prompt management system that stores AI prompts along with their metadata in a structured database. The system will incorporate content hashing to enable integrity verification, change detection, and efficient version management.

## System Architecture

![Prompt Management System Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500)

The system consists of the following components:
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with UUID support
2. **Prompt Loader**: Extracts prompts and metadata from markdown files
3. **Hash Generator**: Creates and validates SHA-256 hashes
4. **API Layer**: Interfaces with your application

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup - these tables are now already set up in the database.  Here are their fields and names: 

-- Create enums for better data consistency
CREATE TYPE prompt_status AS ENUM ('draft', 'active', 'deprecated', 'archived');
CREATE TYPE relationship_type AS ENUM ('extends', 'references', 'prerequisite', 'alternative', 'successor');

-- Note: document_types table already exists, so we're not creating it

-- Prompt Categories Table
CREATE TABLE prompt_categories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    parent_category_id UUID REFERENCES prompt_categories(id), -- For hierarchical categories
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Prompts Table (with metadata)
CREATE TABLE prompts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    content JSONB NOT NULL, -- Store the actual prompt content (JSON or Markdown)
    metadata JSONB, -- Added metadata field for structured metadata from markdown
    document_type_id UUID REFERENCES document_types(id), -- Modified to UUID to match existing table
    category_id UUID REFERENCES prompt_categories(id), -- Reference to categories
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    version VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT '1.0',
    status prompt_status DEFAULT 'active',
    author VARCHAR(255),
    tags TEXT[], -- Use VARCHAR(255) for non-PostgreSQL databases
    file_path VARCHAR(500), -- Path to original file in Git repository
    UNIQUE(name, version)
);

-- Prompt Relationships Table
CREATE TABLE prompt_relationships (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    parent_prompt_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES prompts(id),
    child_prompt_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES prompts(id),
    relationship_type relationship_type NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    -- Prevent duplicate relationships of the same type
    UNIQUE(parent_prompt_id, child_prompt_id, relationship_type)
);

-- Optional: Prompt Usage Table (for tracking execution)
CREATE TABLE prompt_usage (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    prompt_id UUID REFERENCES prompts(id),
    used_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    function_name VARCHAR(255),
    success BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    execution_time INTEGER, -- in milliseconds
    response_summary TEXT
);

-- Note: This schema uses UUID for primary/foreign keys to match your existing document_types table
-- If you need to adapt this for a different DBMS, you may need to adjust the UUID generation approach



### 2. Prompt File Format

Standardize your prompt markdown files to include metadata in a YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Document Extraction Prompt
description: Extracts structured data from legal documents
documentType: legal_document
category: extraction
version: 1.0
author: AI Team
model: gpt-4-1106-preview
temperature: 0.2
maxTokens: 2000
inputSchema:
  document: string
  targetFields: string[]
outputSchema: JSON object with extracted fields
purpose: Extract structured data from legal documents
successCriteria: All target fields correctly identified
dependencies:
  - document_classification_prompt
estimatedCost: ~4000 tokens per document
tags:
  - extraction
  - legal
  - structured-data
---

# Document Extraction Prompt

## Context
You are a legal document analyzer tasked with extracting key information.

## Instructions
Extract the following information from the provided document:
[... rest of prompt content ...]
```

### 3. Prompt Processing Pipeline

Implement a pipeline that processes prompt files:

#### Step 1: Parse Markdown & Extract Metadata

```javascript
function parsePromptFile(filePath) {
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  
  // Extract frontmatter (metadata) and content
  const { data: metadata, content } = matter(fileContent);
  
  // Clean and structure content
  const cleanContent = content.trim();
  
  return {
    metadata,
    content: cleanContent,
    filePath
  };
}
```

#### Step 2: Generate Content Hash

```javascript
function generateContentHash(content) {
  return crypto
    .createHash('sha256')
    .update(content)
    .digest('hex');
}
```

#### Step 3: Structure Metadata JSON

```javascript
function buildMetadataObject(extractedMetadata, content, filePath) {
  const gitInfo = getGitInfo(filePath);
  const contentHash = generateContentHash(content);
  
  return {
    hash: contentHash,
    source: {
      fileName: path.basename(filePath),
      createdAt: fs.statSync(filePath).birthtime.toISOString(),
      gitInfo: {
        branch: gitInfo.branch,
        commitId: gitInfo.commitId
      }
    },
    aiEngine: {
      model: extractedMetadata.model || 'default',
      temperature: extractedMetadata.temperature || 0.7,
      maxTokens: extractedMetadata.maxTokens || 1000
    },
    usage: {
      inputSchema: extractedMetadata.inputSchema || {},
      outputSchema: extractedMetadata.outputSchema || 'text'
    },
    function: {
      purpose: extractedMetadata.purpose || extractedMetadata.description,
      successCriteria: extractedMetadata.successCriteria || '',
      dependencies: extractedMetadata.dependencies || [],
      estimatedCost: extractedMetadata.estimatedCost || ''
    }
  };
}
```

#### Step 4: Store in Database

```javascript
async function storePrompt(parsedPrompt) {
  const { metadata, content, filePath } = parsedPrompt;
  const structuredMetadata = buildMetadataObject(metadata, content, filePath);
  
  // Check if prompt already exists (by hash)
  const existingPrompt = await db.query(
    'SELECT id, version FROM prompts WHERE metadata->>\'hash\' = $1',
    [structuredMetadata.hash]
  );
  
  if (existingPrompt.rows.length > 0) {
    // Handle duplicate (maybe update version)
    console.log(`Prompt already exists with id ${existingPrompt.rows[0].id}`);
    return existingPrompt.rows[0].id;
  }
  
  // Get document type ID
  const documentTypeResult = await db.query(
    'SELECT id FROM document_types WHERE document_type = $1',
    [metadata.documentType]
  );
  
  const documentTypeId = documentTypeResult.rows.length > 0 
    ? documentTypeResult.rows[0].id 
    : null;
  
  // Get or create category
  let categoryId = null;
  if (metadata.category) {
    const categoryResult = await db.query(
      'SELECT id FROM prompt_categories WHERE name = $1',
      [metadata.category]
    );
    
    if (categoryResult.rows.length > 0) {
      categoryId = categoryResult.rows[0].id;
    } else {
      const newCategoryResult = await db.query(
        'INSERT INTO prompt_categories (name) VALUES ($1) RETURNING id',
        [metadata.category]
      );
      categoryId = newCategoryResult.rows[0].id;
    }
  }
  
  // Insert prompt
  const result = await db.query(
    `INSERT INTO prompts 
     (name, description, content, metadata, document_type_id, category_id, 
      version, status, author, tags, file_path)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11)
     RETURNING id`,
    [
      metadata.name,
      metadata.description,
      JSON.stringify(content),
      structuredMetadata,
      documentTypeId,
      categoryId,
      metadata.version || '1.0',
      'active',
      metadata.author,
      metadata.tags || [],
      filePath
    ]
  );
  
  return result.rows[0].id;
}
```

### 4. Prompt Loading & Validation

Implement a mechanism to load prompts from the database, using the hash to verify integrity:

```javascript
async function loadPrompt(promptId) {
  const result = await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM prompts WHERE id = $1',
    [promptId]
  );
  
  if (result.rows.length === 0) {
    throw new Error(`Prompt with ID ${promptId} not found`);
  }
  
  const prompt = result.rows[0];
  
  // Verify hash integrity
  const calculatedHash = generateContentHash(prompt.content);
  const storedHash = prompt.metadata.hash;
  
  if (calculatedHash !== storedHash) {
    console.warn(`Warning: Prompt integrity check failed for ${promptId}`);
    // Optional: Handle hash mismatch (log, report, etc.)
  }
  
  return prompt;
}
```

### 5. Change Detection & Version Management

Implement a system to detect changes when reloading prompts:

```javascript
async function updatePromptFromFile(filePath, promptId) {
  const parsedPrompt = parsePromptFile(filePath);
  const { metadata, content } = parsedPrompt;
  const structuredMetadata = buildMetadataObject(metadata, content, filePath);
  
  // Get existing prompt
  const existingPrompt = await loadPrompt(promptId);
  
  // Check if content has changed
  if (structuredMetadata.hash === existingPrompt.metadata.hash) {
    console.log('No changes detected in prompt content');
    return promptId;
  }
  
  // Content has changed, update version
  const newVersion = incrementVersion(existingPrompt.version);
  
  // Update prompt
  await db.query(
    `UPDATE prompts
     SET content = $1, metadata = $2, version = $3, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     WHERE id = $4`,
    [
      JSON.stringify(content),
      structuredMetadata,
      newVersion,
      promptId
    ]
  );
  
  console.log(`Updated prompt ${promptId} to version ${newVersion}`);
  return promptId;
}

function incrementVersion(version) {
  const parts = version.split('.');
  parts[parts.length - 1] = parseInt(parts[parts.length - 1]) + 1;
  return parts.join('.');
}
```

## User Interface Integration

### 1. "Load Prompt" Button Handler

```javascript
async function handleLoadPromptButton() {
  // Open file dialog to select prompt markdown file
  const filePath = await openFileDialog({
    title: 'Select Prompt File',
    filters: [{ name: 'Markdown', extensions: ['md'] }]
  });
  
  if (!filePath) return;
  
  try {
    // Parse and process prompt file
    const parsedPrompt = parsePromptFile(filePath);
    
    // Preview metadata and content for user confirmation
    showPromptPreview(parsedPrompt);
    
    // If user confirms, store prompt
    const promptId = await storePrompt(parsedPrompt);
    
    // Update UI with success message
    showSuccessMessage(`Prompt loaded successfully with ID: ${promptId}`);
    
    // Refresh prompt list
    refreshPromptList();
  } catch (error) {
    showErrorMessage(`Failed to load prompt: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

### 2. Document Type Association

```javascript
async function associatePromptWithDocumentType(promptId, documentTypeId) {
  await db.query(
    'UPDATE prompts SET document_type_id = $1 WHERE id = $2',
    [documentTypeId, promptId]
  );
  
  console.log(`Associated prompt ${promptId} with document type ${documentTypeId}`);
}
```

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test hash generation with known inputs and outputs
   - Test metadata extraction from sample markdown files
   - Test version increment logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test end-to-end prompt loading from file to database
   - Test prompt retrieval and validation
   - Test change detection and version management

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test handling of malformed markdown files
   - Test handling of missing metadata
   - Test hash collisions (if possible)

## Maintenance Considerations

1. **Database Maintenance**:
   - Implement regular backup of the prompts table
   - Consider archiving old prompt versions

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitor query performance, especially with large number of prompts
   - Consider caching frequently used prompts

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement prompt effectiveness tracking
   - Add support for prompt templates
   - Develop a visual editor for prompts

## Conclusion

Following this implementation plan will result in a robust prompt management system that leverages content hashing for integrity verification, change detection, and version management. The system will integrate with your existing document types and provide a foundation for managing AI prompts across your application.



I need you do design a set of database tables for managing prompts that are used across my application.
The overall development process I use is this
1) load up a number of related documents (usually of the same document_type)into a commercial ai engine - 
2) tell it the kind of information I need extracted 
3) let it evaluate a number of the files it would be applying this to
4) Let it create a prompt that improves my origihnal request and fleshes it out into a markdown document I can store with my project and which will be tracked by git
5) Then open up the "AI" tab of my project which was earlier designed and there should be a "load prompt" button - where I will navigate to the newly created prompt I got from the ai 
6) this prompt is in markdown and will be loaded into a json content field in my prompts database table along with approriate metadata from the prompt file
7) I will do this repeatedly - I expect to have quite a few prompts added over time.  EAch promopt should have an associated document_type that in the future when it detects a document_type that it has a prompt for and when requested it will apply that prompt to a document with that data type
8) usually the setup for and the calling of the prompt will be handled in the context of functions oing specific tasks in my app, and the ai api will be called along with the relevant supoport files such as writing samples or objectives for the ai to measure the loaded document against. THen the ai will execute against the ai, drawing the prompt from the datgabase and applyinjg it,and then the response will go into some document or ui element as directed by the function.  This process will be repeated again and again. 

10) I want the prompt file start with the baseic fieldds it needs to support this workflow - you can sjuggest fields you think would be imp;ortant as well as additional tables that would help to manage the prompt workfklow - but don't make it too complicated to start with.  I just want to get started and perfect the 10 prompts I have so far

11) provide the sql commands to build these tables that I can review before I apply thenm
12) tell me the pros and cons of my approach and suggest any important options you can think of so I can build it better to start with







on the "Classify" page on the "Document Types" add another button on the right next to "Add New Type" called "Ai Request" - when the user clicks on this button we want signifcation ui for the following
1) a multi line edit box where the user can submit a request that defines the purpose of the document type they need
2) a button to submit the request to an ai engineering
3) two windows for the response from ai - the first will have any comments the ai wants to make about the request
4) the other window will have a filled in json set of fields returned from the ai that has the proposed fields for this new document type  - the user will review the proposed json and if necessary edit any fields they want to change
5) FIHALLY an "Add Proposed Document Type" button which will take the json or edited json in the proposed fields window and then submit that to the database to add the new document type
Here are the fields for the document_types
document_types: {
        Row: {
          ai_processing_rules: Json | null
          category: string
          content_schema: Json | null
          created_at: string
          current_num_of_type: number | null
          description: string | null
          document_type: string
          document_type_counts: number | null
          file_extension: string | null
          id: string
          is_ai_generated: boolean
          legacy_document_type_id: number | null
          mime_type: string | null
          required_fields: Json | null
          updated_at: string
          validation_rules: Json | null
        }
        Insert: {
          ai_processing_rules?: Json | null
          category: string
          content_schema?: Json | null
          created_at?: string
          current_num_of_type?: number | null
          description?: string | null
          document_type: string
          document_type_counts?: number | null
          file_extension?: string | null
          id?: string
          is_ai_generated?: boolean
          legacy_document_type_id?: number | null
          mime_type?: string | null
          required_fields?: Json | null
          updated_at?: string
          validation_rules?: Json | null
        }


in the search results list that appears at the bottom of the "roots" tab on the "sync" page can you add a checkbox on each line and when that checkbox is selected display the json for that sources_google record below it.

I think I am getting closer to my ideal solution. I'll tell you what I want and you let me know the safe way to accomplish this and I'll propose my method and see if they line up. Then we'll take action to implement it. 

1) I want to keep the tight coupling between the sources_google file and the expert_document associated with. In the end I think most files will have an assoiated expert_dcoument - but I want to make sure the "Viewer" and the Filetree node will still work if I click on a file to show something in the fileviewer on the "Viewer" page and I believe they do. As long as the filetree on the "viewer" doesn't require an expert_documents redord to be created or associated with an expert_document then I think the "Viewer" is good as is.  Can you check this for me.

THen my problem is that the existing files and folders that have a missing parent_path simply need to be deleted from the database and readded with an inserted sources_google record that does have the proper parent_path in it and then if what you are saying is true I should be able to view all my files in sources_google in the "viewer" properly.

Under the "Cleanup" tab can you add ui to delete records based on created_at date - since the original files I want to keep have just 2 dates in february where I added them, and all the other files I want to delete will have later created_at dates.  Can you build a simpole list that queries sources_google for all files and writes out the createt_at date and a count of file sthat have that date.  IF you also put a checkbox on each line and add a delete button with confirmatin then I think I can easily clean up the newer files. 


On the "sync" page where tabs are add a new tab called "Cleanup" 
Your job is to write a new function and put on a button that fixes the function that is called 
by "Preview Contents" to ensure the parent_path is being set correctly in a way that will make the sources_google inserted files that are inserted by googleDriveService are able to be viewed in the by the viewer. At same time I am concerned about the tight coupling of the "Viewer" pages filetree code that has a tight coupling between the expert_documents records and the sources_google table.  I know why it was added so we could display in the ui info from the associated expert_documents record, but going forward I need to think through whether this is a good idea as some sources_google may never have an associated expert_document once I have a lot of root folders files and folders added.  What do you think aabout this issue.   While I am figuring this out I do not want to break any existing funtionality that's why I am asking you to write new code for it under the "Cleanup" tab.


   when files are inserted from Preview. 



on the "Docs" page the "Sync database" perhaps has 2 issues:
1) it seems to be processing more than 91 files - which is all it says it finds.
2) I just added two new files undereath the docs folder that is off the root. The file I added is on the path: docs/development-process-specification.md   but I don't think your "Sync Database" function is finding these new files - perhaps it was using another way to get the file information, but now it needs to live scan my local mono repo directoy to identify all the markdown files across the project - it probably needs to go up to 5 levels deep to jmake sure it identifes all the files as some of them are under specifie


I now believe there are two different ways you are parsing folders and files underneath a root folder id.  There is the way you are doing it under the "Preview Contents" button and there is the way you are doing it for filetree under the "Viewer". Could you compare these two methods and explain to me the difference and determine which is the better way.  I think it is the way you are doing the "Preview Contents" but I need to know.



on the "sync" page under the "roots" tab there is a list box right below a title called: "Roots Folder Summary".  You have successfully added the checkboxes. Now when you click on them use the logic that is on the "Preview Contents" when you click it. It receives a folder_id from the "Google Drive Folder ID" text box, but instead you can hand off the folder_id that is on the checked line in the list under the "Roots" tab under "Root Folders Summary". And just like the "Preview Contents" button show the folders and files associated with the folder_id just as you did on the "Folders" tab ui


Looking over the 12 or so pages I've had you build latetly, provide me with an in-depth description, summary, spec / context  of the process we are using to design, build and iterate now.  Please include all the dependencies and tools being used. Create a new markdown file that I can feed to an ai prompt evaluating my current 90 documentation files against my new process.  I will be using it to feed to an ai prompt that summarizes and evaluates my documentationh against this spec, so that I can focus on just the most important documentation. 

The "Supabase" page has 0 couhnts for the "Tables" and "Objects". Obviously thius is incorrect, can you check why the query that is doiung this is not correct because now there are about 30 tables in the database that should be returns.  



Current Development Context:
The project is a React-based web application for content management with Supabase as the backend. We're currently focused on implementing the command history tracking system and improving documentation organization. Key technologies include TypeScript, React, Supabase, and PostgreSQL functions. The team is prioritizing improvements to the file metadata synchronization system and document processing workflows. We're actively refactoring code to improve reusability and reduce duplication.


Build a "Viewer2" page that is based on the "Viewer" page with these key differences
1) It is the fileTree node I am most interested in
2) Right now it is hardcoded to dispay the Files and Folders from the "Dynamic Healing Discussion Group" and it works Great
3) Right now it also fortunately drawing from the entire sources_google table
4) Currently there are 4 "Root" folders in the sources_google that are the high level folder under which all folders and files are hierarchically nested. I want you to Rebuild the filetree - so create a newfiletree without and don't touch the original file tree.
5) I want you to deliberately exclude the folders and files that are under the "Dynamic Healing Discussion Group" - as well as exclude it.
6) But I want you to display the other 3 root folders in a collapsible fashion with all their respective nested folders and files under each of the root folder - in the same collapsible fashion.  You can find these root folders by querying on is_root = 1 
7) For now on this new page we don't need the pills on the left and we don't need the filew viewer on the right.  I am just trying to make sure the new tree node can successfully display these 3 root folders and their files and folders






I am giving you a markdown folder - even though the "Dynamic Healing Discussion Group" is acting like a root folder on the "Viewer" page, the table 

| NAME | ID | FILES | FOLDERS | TOTAL |
|------|----|----|------|----|
| RUTs Book | 1fuItvn1UAdAnsrz8-BSkBuGGlHwf-kH4 | 0 | 18 | 18 |
| Dynamic Healing Discussion Group | 1wriOM2j2IglnMcejplqG_XcCxSIfoRMV | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| References.RUTs | 12-zEMUDy5xaZmbza5nWB1wFjgFBP0JHR | 5 | 12 | 17 |
| Polyvagal Steering Group | 1T_kdfI00RbYfrGCIXSDomP2WTI53EKVW | 2 | 48 | 50 |



On the "Sync" page on the right side there are two buttons: "Sync Selected Folder" and "Preview Contents". Can you change the name of this "Preview Contents" to not conflict with the other "Preview Contents" button and make the preview work with the contents from the results that is returned after the "Sync Selected Folder" is finished.  



On the "Sync" page under the "Folders" tab there is a "Select Folder" and below that a combobox that lists names to select from.  That combobox should use the logic from the "Roots" tab ui that finds all the sources_google that have the is_root = 1.  Also, if there is local storage associated with this dropdown, please remove it and simply query it to populate it with the folders that are the root folders.  I think the "current folder" in local storage and previous local storage on this dropdown was messing things up. 


add anothe text search box on the Roots tab further down that where I can paste the name of a sources_google record - hit a button and get the id back that I can paste into another text edit box.  Also add to the json output for each of the roots folder - a count of how many files and folders are associated with that root

on tne sync page add a new tab called Roots 
And write a query that will show the these fields just for the rows that have the is_root set and then display a window where I see the json of these fields.  Also provide a text box where I can paste in a unique identifer for a sources_google row and it will set the is_root field to 1 or true for that record

sources_google: {
        Row: {
          id: string
          document_type_id: string | null
          drive_id: string
          expert_id: string | null
          is_root: boolean | null
          last_indexed: string | null
          mime_type: string
          modified_time: string | null
          name: string
          parent_folder_id: string | null
          parent_id: string | null
          parent_path: string | null
          path: string | null
          size: number | null
          size_bytes: number | null
          sync_error: string | null
          sync_id: string | null
          sync_status: string | null
          updated_at: string
          web_view_link: string | null
        }

on the "Sync" page under the "Folders" tabs 
there is a button called "Add & Sync New Folder" 
plase archive the code supporting that button
then remove that button for the ui and move the button called "Preview Contents" in it's place
then add a new temporary button called "Test Insert" that will look through the code on the Sync page for code that was successfully used before to insert new records into the sources_ggogle table. Make this a test button to see that we can insert one mock record into the database table.


TASK: Implement a hybrid search system for markdown documentation files

CONTEXT:
- Local development environment
- Searching both Supabase metadata and local markdown files
- Need to handle both quick metadata searches and full content searches
- Using TypeScript with React
- Files stored locally, metadata in Supabase documentation_files table

DATABASE STRUCTURE:
documentation_files table:
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "file_path": "string", 
  "file_hash": "string | null",
  "last_indexed_at": "string",
  "last_modified_at": "string",
  "summary": "string | null",
  "metadata": "Json | null",
  "manual_tags": "string[] | null",
  "ai_generated_tags": "string[] | null",
  "created_at": "string | null",
  "updated_at": "string | null"
}

REQUIRED TYPES:

```typescript
interface SearchResult {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  file_path: string;
  matchType: 'metadata' | 'content';
  context?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  summary?: string;
  relevance: number;
}

interface SearchOptions {
  includeTags?: boolean;
  includeContent?: boolean;
  maxResults?: number;
  fuzzyMatch?: boolean;
}

interface UseDocSearchReturn {
  search: (term: string, options?: SearchOptions) => Promise<SearchResult[]>;
  isSearching: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
}
```

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Custom Hook (useDocSearch.ts):
```typescript
function useDocSearch(): UseDocSearchReturn {
  const [isSearching, setIsSearching] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);
  
  const search = async (
    searchTerm: string, 
    options: SearchOptions = {}
  ): Promise<SearchResult[]> => {
    setIsSearching(true);
    setError(null);
    
    try {
      // Parallel execution of metadata and content search
      const [metadataResults, contentResults] = await Promise.all([
        searchMetadata(searchTerm, options),
        options.includeContent ? searchContent(searchTerm, options) : []
      ]);
      
      // Combine and sort results by relevance
      return sortAndDedupResults([...metadataResults, ...contentResults]);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err as Error);
      return [];
    } finally {
      setIsSearching(false);
    }
  };
  
  return { search, isSearching, error };
}
```

2. Metadata Search Function:
```typescript
async function searchMetadata(
  term: string,
  options: SearchOptions
): Promise<SearchResult[]> {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('documentation_files')
    .select('*')
    .or(`
      title.ilike.%${term}%,
      summary.ilike.%${term}%,
      manual_tags.cs.{${term}}
    `)
    .limit(options.maxResults || 20);

  if (error) throw error;

  return data.map(doc => ({
    id: doc.id,
    title: doc.title,
    file_path: doc.file_path,
    matchType: 'metadata',
    tags: doc.manual_tags,
    summary: doc.summary,
    relevance: calculateMetadataRelevance(doc, term)
  }));
}
```

3. Content Search Function:
```typescript
async function searchContent(
  term: string,
  options: SearchOptions
): Promise<SearchResult[]> {
  const { data: files } = await supabase
    .from('documentation_files')
    .select('id, title, file_path')
    .limit(options.maxResults || 50);

  const results = await Promise.all(
    files.map(async (file) => {
      try {
        const content = await fs.readFile(file.file_path, 'utf-8');
        const matches = options.fuzzyMatch 
          ? fuzzyMatch(content, term)
          : content.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase());

        if (matches) {
          return {
            id: file.id,
            title: file.title,
            file_path: file.file_path,
            matchType: 'content',
            context: getSearchContext(content, term),
            relevance: calculateContentRelevance(content, term)
          };
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error reading ${file.file_path}:`, error);
      }
      return null;
    })
  );

  return results.filter(Boolean) as SearchResult[];
}
```

4. Helper Functions:
```typescript
function getSearchContext(content: string, term: string): string {
  const index = content.toLowerCase().indexOf(term.toLowerCase());
  const start = Math.max(0, index - 100);
  const end = Math.min(content.length, index + term.length + 100);
  return content.slice(start, end) + '...';
}

function calculateMetadataRelevance(doc: any, term: string): number {
  let score = 0;
  if (doc.title.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())) score += 10;
  if (doc.summary?.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())) score += 5;
  if (doc.manual_tags?.includes(term)) score += 3;
  return score;
}

function calculateContentRelevance(content: string, term: string): number {
  const matches = content.toLowerCase().split(term.toLowerCase()).length - 1;
  return matches;
}

function sortAndDedupResults(results: SearchResult[]): SearchResult[] {
  const seen = new Set<string>();
  return results
    .filter(result => {
      if (seen.has(result.id)) return false;
      seen.add(result.id);
      return true;
    })
    .sort((a, b) => b.relevance - a.relevance);
}
```

5. Usage Component:
```typescript
function DocSearch() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState<SearchResult[]>([]);
  const { search, isSearching, error } = useDocSearch();

  const handleSearch = async () => {
    const searchResults = await search(searchTerm, {
      includeTags: true,
      includeContent: true,
      maxResults: 20,
      fuzzyMatch: true
    });
    setResults(searchResults);
  };

  return (
    <div className="doc-search">
      <div className="search-input">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={searchTerm}
          onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Search documentation..."
        />
        <button 
          onClick={handleSearch}
          disabled={isSearching}
        >
          {isSearching ? 'Searching...' : 'Search'}
        </button>
      </div>

      {error && (
        <div className="error-message">
          Error: {error.message}
        </div>
      )}

      <div className="search-results">
        {results.map(result => (
          <SearchResultCard
            key={result.id}
            result={result}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Verify search works with empty string
2. Check handling of non-existent files
3. Test performance with large number of files
4. Verify deduplication of results
5. Test fuzzy matching accuracy
6. Verify error handling
7. Check relevance sorting accuracy

ERROR HANDLING:
1. File read errors
2. Database query errors
3. Invalid search terms
4. Missing file paths
5. Malformed markdown content

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Keep search operations cancelable
- Consider debouncing search input
- Cache recent search results
- Add loading states for better UX
- Consider implementing pagination
- Add keyboard shortcuts for search
- Include search analytics for future optimization

Please implement this search system following these specifications. The implementation should be efficient for local development use while maintaining extensibility for future enhancements.








a fee more changes are needed on the "Docs New" page

1) move the "Search" button and the "Sync Database" to the far left
2) make the text search window underneath these buttons only go up to the viewer - so it will be shorter
3) move the  collapsible summary section on the right up as high as you can and put the markdown viewer right below - it don't change any of their funtionalityh



Now on the "Docs New" page - remove "Documentation Explorer" on the top left to make more rooom for the viewer. Then on the right above the viewer make the file summary and json short viewer collapsible, starting out with it being collapsed, but you can open it up to see the content it you want.  Toggle it closed or open as you click on it.

Then on the left where you are showing the meta data and the files that are in the documentation_files dataase - I need you to now display them in a hierarchical fashion - underneath their nested folders.  I think you have what you need to do this in the file_path of the meta data files, but it will require some parsing and recursive processing to extract the folders from the path that is in the file and display files underneat that path.  
Also now, display the metadat about the file - the created date, upated date, and file size would be a start - Lets see what you come up with. Ideally you would start with everything expanded - but then you could collapse folders if you needed to and then expand thme if needed. 



On the "Classify" page under the edit mode of the "Document Types" tab where there are editable fields for updating redcords in the documnent_types field - there is a "Category" field with a wide dropdown right below it - can you make that dropdown populated with the existing categories that are found across all the docunment types so far. I want to select a new cateogry to apply to an existing docunent type - we can leave aside for the moment what do you do to create new categories. We can tackle that later.

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Verify file reading works correctly
2. Ensure markdown renders properly
3. Confirm error handling works
4. Test loading states
5. Verify path handling is secure

ERROR HANDLING:
1. File not found
2. Invalid file path
3. File read errors
4. Database query errors
5. Network request failures

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Validate file paths
2. Only allow .md extensions
3. Ensure paths stay within project directory
4. Sanitize file content before rendering

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- This is for development only
- Keep implementation simple
- Use direct file system access
- Assume trusted environment
- No need for authentication
- Focus on functionality over security

Please implement this markdown viewer following these specifications. The implementation should be simple, direct, and suitable for local development use only.






Remove the "Docs" page and archive the code that was supporting it.  Once that code is archived, please Rename the "Docs New" page to "Docs" 
  
  
  
   on the "Classify" page under the "Document Types" tab there are displays of each document_type records shwon as a filtered list.   Please add the following fields from the document_types to each records' display. 
  
       "description": "string | null",                                             │
│         "mime_type": "string | null",                                                 │
│         "file_extension": "string | null",                                            │
│         "is_ai_generated": "boolean", 

Keep everhting else ais is if possible. It's okay if you want to word wrap the description or mime_type field. 
 
 
 I think I created some new duplicate code accidently - I noticde on the "Classify" page therre are now two tabs that say "Document Types"  The first one is pretty good - I like the filtering by the pills and showing the records below as you click on different pills so let's keep that one, but move the button from the second tab that sayhs "+ Add New Type" - it is light green and move it onto the first "Document Types" in the same location as it is on the other page. be careful because of the duplicate coded that surely must be there to manage nearly identical ui displays - don't get mixed up.  Once I see the button is moved correctlY I wil likely archive the second "Document Types:" page display and remove it from the page - but not yet, I want to see the firsts docuiment types tab working correctly with the new button before I can do that.
 
  
 
 
 
 
  Make a tottally new page called "Docs New" 
  make the toip part look just like the "Docs" page
1) keep the search text box - but make it half as wide'
2) move the search button to the right of it and
3) move the  "Sync Database" button to the right of the "Search" button
4)  import the function that drives the "Sync Database" function into the code for this page
5) then reedo the hierarchical tree viewer on the left entirely with new code you store on this new page
6) At first it shhoujld shjow the Json for about 30 records from the documentation_files - and it shoold write out on the left side the total jnukmber of records in the documentation_files
7) on teh right side I want a file viewer
a) for the top 3rd I want a window to display the text from the summary field of the file - eventually it will contain an iupdated ai summary that will be nicely formmatted json - that will identify important characteristics of each of the documnentation files - but for now it will just display the "summary" field
b) then below that I want a markdown viewer that will read the file_path from the documentation_file records and retrieve and display the markdown file from the local file if possible - it should read and display the file in it's entirety - just by retrieving and loading the file from disk - not by esxtracting out poritions from the other documentagtion tables.
Let's start with this and then I will have you change some things once I can see the data for the files is there.

  
  "Search" Button but mov
  
  On the "Sync" page under the "Folders" tab archive the code that is called when you click the "Add & Sync New Folder" button and then once it is safely archived remove that code. Keep the "Preview Contents" button as it is working beautifully. Search through the "Sync" page for code that inserts the synced google drive data into the sources_google table.  I know it is there and has recently worked. Temporarily add a button that will just insert 1 record into the sources_google table using the logic that worked before so we can see the insert actually working. 
 
 
 On the "Docs Explorer Page" rename the Page to "Docs" now that you have ardchived the other versions which weree confusing us.  Keep the "Sync Database" button and functionality as it seems to be working correctly.  Remove the "Run Report" button but not change the underlying script that is located at scripts/markdown-report.sh.  "Remove the "Process Queue" button and its functionality since I don't understand what it does. Remove the 4 dashboard elements below that that are called "Indexed Files", "Queue Status", "Processed" and "Last Updated". Then below that where you have a hierarchical view of the markdown folders and files in the app (based on what is in the database after the "sync database" functionality updated the database - keep that file navigation and when you click on any of the markdown files - have it open up and display the actual markdown file in the viewer on the right - make that work properly please.  


 Archive the "Docs" page code and excise it from the routing. then test that it is properly archived.

 Archive the "Doc Tables Test" Page and excise it from the routing. Then test that it is properly archived.

 Rename the "Guts Example" page to "Guts"


 On the "Classify" page under the "Document Types" tab there is a light green button that says "+ Add New Type" - remove that button and its associated code and instead add a new tab to the right of the "Reulsts" table called "Document Types" and create a crud ui under that tab to manage the database table "document_types" table. If you find multiple instances of "document_types" funtionality already note that as I know there is some duplicate code. Let me know whether you keep all of this in the "Classify" page code or have  to import it from other places.  Be very careful about this because you could get tripped up by the multiple instances of older or unfnished code for document_types that may be on other pages. What you are building on the "Classify" page should be the source of truth code for managing documnent types. 
 
  Here are the fields wer care about manipulating {
  "document_types": {
    "Row": {
      "id": "string",
      "document_type": "string",
      "category": "string",
      "description": "string | null",
      "mime_type": "string | null",
      "file_extension": "string | null",
      "is_ai_generated": "boolean",
    },
    "Required Fields for Insert": {
      "document_type": "string",
      "category": "string"
    },
    "Relationships": []
  }
}


 
 
 make a new page called "Gmail"
 it should be a dashboard like the other dashboard you have built me 
 it will hook up to a python interface that will do the work
 it will help me manage my gmail analysis workflow which
 1) consists of searching through my gmail from the last time I did the search
 2) adding the new emails to my emails database table which has all the emails from before
 3) here are the fields of the email table which I already have some 5000 entries:
 {
  "emails": {
    "Row": {
      "id": "string",
      "email_id": "number",
      "domain_id": "string",
      "sender": "string | null",
      "subject": "string | null",
      "content": "string | null",
      "to_recipients": "string | null",
      "date": "string | null",
      "attachment_cnt": "number | null",
      "url_cnt": "number | null",
      "contents_length": "number | null",
      "is_valid": "number | null",
      "is_in_contents": "number | null",
      "is_in_concepts": "number | null",
      "is_ai_process_for_concepts": "number | null",
      "created_at": "string | null",
      "updated_at": "string"
    },
    "Relationships": [
      {
        "foreignKeyName": "emails_domain_id_fkey",
        "columns": ["domain_id"],
        "referencedRelation": "domains",
        "referencedColumns": ["id"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
4) There is another element after that that I do in the processing. It extracts the content from the body of the email into the following table:
CREATE TABLE "email_contents" (
            email_content_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            email_id INTEGER,
            how_many_participants INTEGER,
            participants TEXT,
            summary_of_the_email TEXT,
            is_science_discussion INTEGER,
            is_science_material INTEGER,
            is_meeting_focused INTEGER,
            good_quotes TEXT
        )
It references the original email table through the email_id but it adds the important fiels above
5) to geneerate this file I use ai to get the summary and analyze the flags
6) another file I generate from this are all the urls I find in the email content 
Most of the heavy lifthing of the processing will be done by a python service locally but the ui to manage all of this we need from you



on the Sync page 
on the main dashboard there is a search button on the bottom right that says "Search folder" with an edit box nextg to it where you paste a folder id - once you the press the button it properly searches and adds those files to the sources-google files. DO you know which button I am referring to?

Now if you have the right button - I want you to find the function it is calling and hook that up to the "Add & Sync New Folder Button" under the Folders tab under the Sync dasbhoard?  DO you know which button I am referring to? 

No I want you to replace whatever function was being called on that second button with the function that is being called on the first button.  Can you do that?  Do you need any more info to make sure you are working on the right ui






e know which ones to keep, read, delete or ujpdate.  

How to Use the Documentation System

on the classify page under the dpocument types tab there is an add new type button which when pressed expands out a set of 3 fields - Document Type Name, Category and description

Here is the table for the document_types that is in supabase.  I need you to add or revise the  options for the add new type  button in addition to the 3 that you have  
1) has a choice for toggling is_ai_generated
2) has a dropdown for category based on all the categories in the document_types so far
3) has a dropdown for mime_type based on what is available so far in the document_types so far

Finallhy with regard to getting help from the ai - I was going to apply this documeent tpye analysis as a sophistidated ai prompt to each markdown file in turn and then read all the ai summaries to do some analysiss.  but i'm wonderikng since mot of the markdown files are not very big and I can skip the prompts markdowns since I knmow I want them and what they are for, could I load up all the markdown files into one ste of json which I submit to the ai, and wojuld it be able to do the evaluation of those fields I mentioned all at once - and come back with a suggestion abou twhat to do with each of these files - that I could then associate with the markdown metadata I will be redcording in the database - woud this approach work, because I coujld bypass dealing the markdown files individuall and deal with them all at once.  These are my questions.



I want you to implement what you suggested only carefully follow my .cursorulres for agent
1) do no harm to existing ui and code
2) writte out a migration file but let me run it in supabase
3) write out scripts as necessary - but don't run them uless you ask me first 
4) don't make changes to the ui unless you confirm them first with me
5) first let me make the new document type before you go doing this
6) also the metadata documentation database tables now have datat that you can query and use if that changes how your implmentation works - 


cleanup markdown files:

Now be very careful and make a very careful change on the Viewer Page.  DO NOT BREAK the fileTree, or filetreeItem or the fileviewer on the "Viewer". Put a combobox right below the  pills that lets the user choose which folder they want to view the files for in the viewer. It should populate the combobox using the same logic that obtains the values in the combobox to the right of the sync statistics section on the sync page - which currently shows the two folders that have been successfully synced to the sources_google records. when the dropdown is selected it should load up all the folders and files associated with that folder_id in our sources_google database. Does this make sense to you?  Do you know exactly what to do or do you want more clarifcation?


  Right now the view is hardwired to the Dynamic Healing Group Files but now there are already multiple high level folders to choose from and soon there wil be more.  Then the viewer should just display the folders and files from that cuirrenty selected high level folder. You can store the currently selected folder from the folders page in local storage so when you start a new sessoin it will remember the folder it last synced. If the folder is changed in the viewer window then the current folder should be stored in local storage so the next time it loads it uses that folder to feed the viewer



in the process of developoment all kinds of markdown files are crated all over tghe place (since this is a mono repo.  I am trying to make things as consistent as possible, and keep things in one docs folder which is in the root dir but except for the special case of prompts - which I am tryhing to sort out - which is a folder underneat the docs root folder, I want things to be simpole, and because I am working on one particular monolithic tooling app which is just one of the apps in myu mono repo I end up with markdown documnentation files and readme files created by ai - all over the place.  What is the best practice in a mono repo - I want to keep everhthing in one root docs folder because in the future many of my apps will share code and I don't want duoplication.  On the other hand there are legimate reasons to have a docs folder within a project for poroject specific information - or is it necessary - ofen then it adds to confusion.  Help straighten my thinkikng out on this.  Also know that I am building tooling that mostly favors the root docs folder - and a dedicated dashboard that will display these markdown document files from my local development machine in a viewer that will read and display the files.  This is a factor in my question as well.  Please advise so I can sort through this.  Settling on my approach will help make my repository less messy.  


HEre are your instructions:
Okay imoplement this but follow my cursorrules for the agent
1) do no harm to existing code or ui
2) do not make ui changes with out first asking me
3) if necessary give me any simple dataase imp;rovments that might help with this - but only do so if necessary 
4) create sceriopts to do these things for the markdown files and foldder - to improve the organization according to the principles you just laid out
5) leave any files that are under prompts folders alone - whether they are under the root docs folder or within the public folder or anywhere else in the apps folders - I am still trying to figure out how to deal with them
6) perfect a tree command that passes in the name of the app that it applies to - I think you will find one in the package.json file I am incluiding:  
7) create a report of what you find from scanning the tree command with regard to all the markdown files - I do want to have them in the local directory - but only following the riules you specified


Below is the plan that was created by ai to execute on my questions above.
Figure out the best way to implement this plan and go for it


Documentation Organization in a Monorepo
You're facing a common challenge in monorepos: balancing centralized documentation with project-specific docs. Let me help clarify some best practices and suggest an approach that aligns with your tooling goals.
Best Practices for Documentation in Monorepos
Recommended Structure
the
Principles to Follow
Single Source of Truth: Keep shared, high-level documentation in the root /docs folder.
README.md in Every Project: Each app/package should have a README.md that:
Briefly describes what the project does
Links to relevant documentation in the root /docs folder
Contains quick start instructions
Does NOT duplicate information from the root docs
Minimize Project-Specific Docs Folders: Only create a /docs folder within a project if:
The documentation is truly specific to that project's implementation
The documentation would not make sense in any other context
The documentation is extensive enough to warrant its own folder
Cross-Reference Instead of Duplicate: When a project needs to reference shared concepts, link to the root docs rather than duplicating information.
Specific Recommendations for Your Case
Since you're building tooling that favors the root docs folder and a dedicated dashboard viewer, I recommend:
Centralize Most Documentation: Keep as much as possible in the root /docs folder, organized by topic rather than by project.
Use Frontmatter for Organization: Add YAML frontmatter to your markdown files to indicate which projects they apply to:
Implementation
Create a Documentation Index: Maintain an index file that maps documentation to projects, which your dashboard can use to filter relevant docs.
Standardize README.md Files: Create a template for project README.md files that includes:
Project description
Quick start
Links to relevant documentation in the root docs folder
Development workflow
Documentation Migration Plan: If you already have docs scattered throughout the repo:
Create a script to identify all markdown files
Evaluate each for whether it should be moved to the root docs
Update references to maintain links
Implementation for Your Dashboard
For your dashboard that displays markdown files:
Configure to Prioritize Root Docs: Set up your dashboard to primarily look at the /docs folder.
Add Project Context: When displaying a document, show which projects it applies to.
Implement Search Across All Docs: Allow users to search across all documentation, regardless of location.
Provide Filtering: Let users filter docs by project, category, or other metadata from frontmatter.
This approach gives you the best of both worlds: centralized documentation for shared concepts and cross-cutting concerns, while still allowing for project-specific information where truly needed. It also aligns well with your goal of building tooling around the root docs folder.





on the code dashboard make a new tab called cleanup which should help with the following
1) run a tree command (that ignores config files and .env files and node files and others it shouldn't track), but shows all the files in the entire repo. But it shoujld primarily be for cleanup around a given app which somehow needs to be passed in as a   This tree command should then be passed to an analysis file that will help identify potential dups and files that are out of place




Make a new page called Cmds 
It will be a dashboard similar to the other dashboards you've built for me. 
belwo is a spec of what I have so far to work with - the database tables and the front end code and the scripts - use these to guide your solution. Also a markdown file explaining about the system. Use these within your dashboard solution plus anything else is useful in building a cmds dasbhoard to help manaage the complexity of the different commands that need to be called regulalry (one off commands and special cirumstance we will still call in the terminal - and our dashboard is not designed to replace the terminal - just to help manage the complexity of commands in development )

-- here are the sql tables an functions that got create in the database:

-- Create extension for UUID generation if not exists

Here is the markdown file that explains about these functions in the database oand ion the front end and the commands and scdripts inolved



# Command History Tracking System

This system tracks and analyzes command execution history, providing insights into command usage patterns, success rates, and suggestions for frequently used commands.

## Features

- **Command History Logging**: Automatically logs executed commands with metadata such as execution time, duration, and exit code
- **Command Sanitization**: Removes sensitive information from commands before storing them
- **Command Categories**: Organizes commands into categories for better organization
- **Favorite Commands**: Save frequently used commands for quick access
- **Command Analytics**: Provides insights into command usage patterns and success rates
- **Command Suggestions**: Suggests commands based on usage patterns and success rates

## Database Structure

The system uses the following tables:

- `command_categories`: Stores command categories
- `command_history`: Logs executed commands with metadata
- `favorite_commands`: Stores favorite commands
- `command_patterns`: Defines patterns for sanitizing sensitive information
- `command_suggestions` (view): Provides command suggestions based on usage patterns

## Setup

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Run the following migration files to set up the database schema:

```bash
# Create tables
pnpm supabase migration up 20250601000000_create_command_history_tables.sql

# Create analytics functions
pnpm supabase migration up 20250601000001_create_command_analytics_functions.sql
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# From the repository root
pnpm add -w dotenv @supabase/supabase-js
pnpm add -Dw ts-node typescript @types/node
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the repository root with the following variables:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Usage

### Tracking Commands

Use the `track.sh` script to execute and track commands:

```bash
# Format
./scripts/track.sh [category] [command]

# Examples
./scripts/track.sh git "git push origin main"
./scripts/track.sh pnpm "pnpm install marked"
```

### Setting Up Command Aliases

Add the following aliases to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file for easier command tracking:

```bash
# Replace with the actual path to your track.sh script
alias tgit='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh git'
alias tpnpm='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh pnpm'
alias tbuild='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh build'
alias tdeploy='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh deploy'
alias tdb='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh database'
alias tsys='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh system'
alias tother='~/path/to/scripts/track.sh other'
```

Then use them like:

```bash
tgit "git push origin main"
tpnpm "pnpm install marked"
```

## TypeScript Service

The `commandHistoryService.ts` provides methods for interacting with the command history system:

```typescript
// Import the service
import { CommandHistoryService } from '../services/commandHistoryService';

// Create an instance
const commandHistory = new CommandHistoryService();

// Record a command
await commandHistory.recordCommand(
  'git push origin main',
  'git',
  0,
  1500,
  'Pushed changes to main branch',
  ['deployment', 'git']
);

// Get command history
const history = await commandHistory.getCommandHistory({
  categoryFilter: 'git',
  successFilter: true,
  searchTerm: 'push',
  pageSize: 10,
  pageNumber: 1
});

// Get favorite commands
const favorites = await commandHistory.getFavoriteCommands();

// Get command suggestions
const suggestions = await commandHistory.getCommandSuggestions();

// Get most used commands
const mostUsed = await commandHistory.getMostUsedCommands('30 days', 10);

// Get command usage by category
const categoryUsage = await commandHistory.getCommandUsageByCategory('30 days');
```

## Analytics Functions

The system provides several analytics functions:

- `sanitize_command`: Sanitizes command text based on patterns
- `get_most_used_commands`: Gets the most used commands within a time period
- `get_command_usage_by_category`: Gets command usage statistics by category
- `get_command_history`: Gets command history with filtering and pagination
- `increment_favorite_command_usage`: Increments usage count for a favorite command

## Command Sanitization

The system sanitizes commands to remove sensitive information before storing them. Add patterns to the `command_patterns` table to define what should be sanitized:

```sql
INSERT INTO command_patterns (pattern, replacement, is_active, description)
VALUES 
  ('password=\w+', 'password=***', true, 'Hide passwords'),
  ('token=\w+', 'token=***', true, 'Hide tokens'),
  ('key=\w+', 'key=***', true, 'Hide keys');
```

## Security

The system uses Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure that users can only access their own command history and favorite commands. The following policies are applied:

- Users can only view their own command history
- Users can only manage their own favorite commands
- Command categories and patterns are accessible to all authenticated users 



Make a new page called AI
It will be a dashboard similar to the other dashboards you've built for me. 
Its purpose is to help me write sophisticated prompts with sonnet 3.7 
Here is what is working well for me that I need the dashboard to support:
1) similar to the "Projects" of claude pro - I need to select quite a few files that give it context for building a prompt that will assist the ai in writing a very detailed prompt I then save as a markdown file (hopefully in my root directory) in the prompts folder that is this prompt in markdown format.  Sometimes dedicated JSON to fill the results for the ai is provided to the prompt to help it fill and make sense of unstrcutred data that it extracts from the file content.  I then load that up into a query to the claude sonnet 3.7 api and apply the prompt to a a file or one or more files.  The code that this is wrapped in is usually a functioh on one of my pages that retrieves the content, applies the prompt using the claude api and retrieveds the json data and stores it in an experts_document records in the processed_content field
2) something that lists all the prompts based on their filenames - and maybe has the last associated date that the file was updated - but sopmethjing simople based on the stored file metadata on my local project.  This sits on top of a simple markdown viewer
3) Other functions I need - a markdown viewer that will allow me to read the prompts. The viewer will alway be reading from a local version of the markdown file that is stored in my root docs folder in some subfolder - for now
4) Other functions you can think of that would be helpful in using the claude api for sonnet 3.7 - for example - other properties such as temperature (whicih I almosrt always make 0 as I don't want the ai to make anything up).  These settings would be stored in localsttorage so the values would persist over multiple sessionhs (or eventually perhaps in the database - but not yet)
Here are some paths to prompts I am buidling or have built so far: docs/prompts/code-analysis-prompt.md
docs/prompts/document-classification-prompt.md
docs/prompts/react-component-analysis-prompt.md
docs/prompts/expert-extraction-prompt.md
These prompt are very effective in extracting the content from the source files they are applied to.
One more thing to consider is that applying the prompts will be based most likely on what document type a file is classified as - below is what the json is for that table.  This should somehow be integrated into your design.  In the future there will be a relationship between the prompt and the document type - I will probably be building them out by document type - so now that I think about it if you listed the files by document types - I could select a certain of number of them to improve the prompt generation.  In fact as I build out new prompts I may want to create a new document type (problably of json mime type - and then I can apply that to the expert_documents after the ai processing on the content has finished - perhaps I can then even view prompts by input and output document tyes)

-- types of primary tables in the database involved in prompts extraction are shown below

Make a new page called Show.



It will NOT be a dashobard like the others, but rather built around the goal of helping users navigate, view and learn from related pdf and docx and ai documents associated with them.  So the viewer is only one component of this page.  It should look good.
It is ultimately going to be a prototype of a dedciated application I will be building.
It involves these 10 tables I am giving you the json for that are already in the datgabase but empty.
The presentations table is the most important as there will be one for every MP4 we have in the system - which now is about 166.  This is the presentation we are building context around - so all of these assets are files that exist mostly on the google drive and are represented in the sources_google file.  In addition most of these files will have been processed by ai or other means and their json or summaries will be in the expert_documents table. 
I am including the path to apps/dhg-improve-experts/src/components/FileViewer.tsx which is a file viewer that uses the drive extracted from the web link in sources_google to view the file using google reader.  It will be an integral part of your solution as ultimately we will be displaying the presetnatiopn.  But how we search for them, use the tagged assets and other presentations to give context (meaning related docx and pdf files and ai summaries associated with them) - that's part of what we want you to come up with.  
Feel free to use the real mp4s, but after that you can mock up the objects that will be represented ihn the database tables, but you do not yet have to interact much with the database.  We just want to explore what it might look life before we go hooking things up.


I am including the the exact types from the 10 tables plus expert_documents and sources_google below.

Make a new page called "Docs".

-- claude code:
1. Fixed the Supabase import path in Docs.tsx
  2. Modified database query methods to work even if the documentation tables
  don't exist yet
  3. Added mock data and error handling for file tree display
  4. Improved file content loading with fallbacks to local content
  5. Created a comprehensive script (process-documentation.ts) to help manage
  documentation files

  The Docs dashboard page is now ready to use and includes:
  - File tree navigation
  - Markdown content viewer
  - Search functionality
  - Tag-based filtering
  - Document statistics

  The script in scripts/process-documentation.ts helps solve your problems by:
  1. Scanning and consolidating markdown files from different locations
  2. Managing prompt files between apps and public folders
  3. Tracking document metadata including creation/modification dates
  4. Creating a central database for all documentation

  You can start using the page at http://localhost:5174/docs




It will be a dashboard similar to the other dashboards you've built for me. 
Its purpose is to help  me manage my markdown documentation files that are in my docs folder in the root of the mono repo.  Here's some of the problems it should help me with
1) many new markdown files are created and they are all over the place - in the apps folder, in the root folder, in other folders - I need to consoldiate the strays
2) my prompt markdown files.  These are very important files as they are loaded and applied to my code to guide ai sessions.  The obvious choice wouold be to have the prompts folder be the only source of truth for these files, but I found out that they needed to be with an apps folder in the public folder for it to work, so on therre is a symlink to the public file in my local apps prompt folder. I need a better way to handle this as it makes having a source of truth difficult
3) then there is the problem of know when the markdown file was created - for that I have created these objects in sql to help manage the process - which you can use in your solution
4) I have settled on a hybrid approach to handling the markdown docs
First you'll see the database metadata I hope to fill - below
Second you have the database functions that have been created that work with these tables
Third - you have instrudtions below here that describes the hybrid approach - note that I have installed the 2 depencides of "marked" and "crypto" that the code depends on
Fourth - hhere is the link to apps/dhg-improve-experts/src/services/documentationService.ts which contains the matching front end code
Fifth - I am sharing the script utility path that is designed to drive the updates: scripts/process-documentation.ts
Sixth - this docs folder will need a markdown viewer integrated into it that will allow me to view the nicely formatted markdown files and there needs to be a tree type of control that will help me choose the file to view easily
Seventh there needs to be a search window that will narrow down the choices of what to view
Eighth - just having the dagte of the update or creation of the markdown file in some ui based element could be very helpful because then I could use history to find them - or a combination
Okay - lets see what you create on these specs


---------- HERE ARE THE VARIOUS OBJECTS INVOLVED - IF THAT HELPS
Summary of Implementation
I've implemented a comprehensive documentation management system according to your requirements. Here's what I've created:
Database Structure
Migration Files:
Created SQL migration files for tables, functions, and search capabilities
Included corresponding down migrations for each file
These files are ready to be run in the Supabase UI
Backend Implementation
DocumentationService:
Created a TypeScript service that handles:
Processing markdown files (extracting frontmatter, sections)
Registering files in the database
Generating summaries and tags (with placeholder AI functionality)
Detecting relationships between documents
Searching and retrieving documentation
Command-Line Tool:
Created a script to process documentation files
Supports scanning directories, processing individual files, and batch processing
Documentation
Usage Guide:
Created a comprehensive markdown guide explaining the system
Includes instructions for setup, usage, and future enhancements
Key Features
Metadata Tracking: Stores metadata about markdown files without modifying them
AI Integration: Placeholder implementation for AI-powered summaries and tagging
Search Functionality: Full-text search with relevance ranking
Relationship Detection: Identifies links between documents
Section Navigation: Tracks document structure for easy navigation
Next Steps
As requested, I've focused on the database structure and backend implementation without modifying the UI. The next steps would be:
Run the migration files in the Supabase UI
Install the required dependencies (marked and crypto)
Create a docs directory and add some markdown files
Run the processing script to populate the database
Implement a UI for browsing and searching documentation
Would you like me to make any adjustments to the implementation or explain any part in more detail?

On the sync page, under the folders tab you can now choose different folders to sync.  This introduces the concept of "current sync folder" which now the sync dashboard needs to reflect everywhere.  Under the folders tab you can now choose which folder you want to sync - and even add new folders - whatever is last synced is the current folder. But perhaps you need to provide a way to select which folder you want to see the statistics for in the sync dashboard and then keep the statistics for that current folder showing the relevant facts for that folder.  

 keeping the guts tables and architecture in mind, provide a way on the 
  code dashboard to analyze all the functions on the viewer page and to add
   them to the function_registry function - with proper formatting, you can
   see one of my attempts in the markdown file: 
  apps/dhg-improve-experts/public/prompts/enhanced-analysis-prompt.md and 
  there are others in docs/prompts/react-component-analysis-prompt.md that 
  tried to detailed ihnformtaionh about the functions. 
  docs/prompts/enhanced-analysis-prompt.md - the main point of these was 
  that when a function gets added to the function_registry we need to 
  classify it according to whether it is for the dashboard, whether it is a
   candidate for further refactoring because it could be part of a utils 
  folder, we need the associatioh to the page it is in, we need to know if 
  is a react function - if you need to use one of these prompts or create a
   new one to help a sophisticated analysis, please reinstate one or more 
  of these prompts to assist you.  Remeber then these functions in the 
  function registry will be available to the guts tables 


Move the Analyze and Registry page and functionality to the code dashboard page as new items across the top and display their respetive ui objects you did before only now under the code page tabs



Make a new page called "Write".
It will be a dashboard similar to the other dashboard you've built for me. 
Its purpose is help ai process a set of related research documents to build compelling summaries from multiple pdfs. It needs to let you choose a folder and or a specific pdf as your primary document and then help you find the related pdfs you wish to associate with the primary docuemnt and an ability to launch an ai prompt to interact with these documents to produce a new summary output.  It should take into account document_types for each of these documents. Lets see what you come up to meet these goals.



Make a new page called "Code" 
It will be a dashboard similar to the other dashboard you've built for me.
It needs to manage the following tasks and any others you think are neceessary
It will support a function registry that is already in the database - it has vital information (gathered and formatted by ai) about each function. it should classify functions whether they are local to a dashboard, or utility based and therefore candiates for refacotring in servcies, functions should be associated with the pages that call them
It should have something about the organization of the app - particularly about the pages on the mainnavbar which is the skeleton of the program.




add an addtional tab on the experts page called profliles. This should display the content from the processed_content field which has json describing various items about an expert.  Format each record on a card and make the json output pretty.


## original code
I need you to add a new experts page soon.  But before you do that I need you to sysematically go through my code and find references to previous work on experts - I think can just search for any thing that has the word expert in it.  I believe there are a lot of orphaned functions and ui dealing with example calls and previous attempts at managing experts. I will be wanting to archive and get rid of those.

To help me do so  Generate a thorough report in markdown syntax that I can put into my docs folder that will assess all the experts code and make suggestikons about wht is needed and what can be removed - and even provide commands to do so I can paste into my terminal


Now that I've cleaned up the experts code I need you to add a new experts page.  It will be a dashboard that will allow me to manage experts similar to all the other dashboards you created for me. I have an existing experts table and I have an existing experts_documents table.  I need to be able to add new experts, edit their information, and delete them.  I will also need to be able to see a list of all experts and select one to view their details.  I will also need to be able to add new expert documents and edit their information, and delete them.  I will also need to be able to see a list of all expert documents and select one to view their details.

The thing about experts is the the information for them comes from many documents. Our goal is to build up and keep current important information about them and even update it periodically. We already have an "experts" table but we need to make it more robust.  Please add the fields you think are neceessary to do this.

Some of our information comes from the presentation announcement docx files which we have in our sources_google table.  We are processing with ai and extracting out the unstructured information that comes from presentation documents that are cvs and bios.  Some of it comes from their research papers. Some of it could come from the web sites that are extracted from some of these documents such as their lab page. Yes, we could even get their linked in profiles.  Basically the experts who create our content videos are the heart of our operation and keeping up to date information about them is crucial.  We also will be building an associated set of tables and ai processing around their research papers and content but that will be a later step.

  We have to take all these sources and extract out the unstructureed (but mostly similar and consistent information ) and put it into the experts table.  We also need to be able to add new experts and edit their information, and delete them.  I will also need to be able to see a list of all experts and select one to view their details.  I will also need to be able to add new expert documents and edit their information, and delete those files. 

  here are the fields in the current experts table

   experts: {
        Row: {
          bio: string | null
          created_at: string

I need you to improve the supabase page.  It is all about the supabase design and how we can improve it to make it more efficient and easier to use.  It needs to be more intuitive and follow the steps required to get the job done.  

Just as you did for now three other pages - classify, sync and transcribe - I need you to do the same for the supabase page.  I want to see all the tables and sql objects that a person managing a sophisticated postgres database needs to know - what we currently have, what is missing or inconsistent, what needs to be added and what needs to be removed. 

I want to see a summary of the tables and their current status and then be able to generate objects such as tables, views, enums, etc. that will make the database more efficient and easier to use.

I need to be able a section that will allow me to manage migrations better - but it doesn't have to follow the traditional up and down path.  It seems I like to have you first generate the commands based on mp prompts and then paste them in the supabase ai and to use the SQL editor to run them.  Usually a mistake in the sql crops up and I paste it into you to troubleshoot and run it until it is successful. It's hard to keep track of that using the traditional up and down migrations, plus the final version of the code that actually worked is usually not in the final migration sql.

Also, I like to generate new versions of the schema and all database objects to paste into the coding ai to help it write better code.  Then in the terminal I regularly export all the types and hand off the current types.ts file to the ai to help it write better code.  My local command always generates the types.ts file in supabase/types.ts.   

Try to keep existing functionality as much as possible and not break anything, but make it more intuitive and easier to use. This will be a very sophisticated supabase database that drives a sophisticated file processing system.





the processing for this will be in python we will have a dedicated folder for the pyton processing to handoff the fujnctionalithy to.  

However this transcribe page will follow in the footstetps of the 2 other dashboards you just did for classify and sync and help us move along the various steps required for the transcription pipeline.  Try not to break existing functionality on this transcribe page.




I need you to improve the entire sync page layout of buttons and functionality - it is too fragmented. It all starts here. 

Let's review - we will have multiple google folders we will be syncing with - 5 I can think of so far and maybe another 15 coming down the pipe. So we will need a way to identify which highe level folder we will be syncing - I know each high level folder has a unique id and that's good but we're going to need to refer to it by name.

I think we need a dashboard similar to the classify page that you just made a dashboard for.  That is an awesome dashboard but here is where it all starts 

1) new folder - recurivesly identify all its subfolders and files and create matching sync files to keep them in sync in the future.  The syncing function heavily uses sources_google but also a cluster of other tables which are used to keep statistics.  we also need the google metadata to be recorded.

2) existing folder - once the sync records are created we have to keep them in sync - identify any new ones, mark the ones no longer available with a soft delet

3) and then we need the summaries - we need to show the sync history - to be able to see where we stand from previous syncs and after syncing again we need to ujpdate that status - you have code and tables for that already

4) sonmething that will tell us about our token status, currently we get one hour based google tokens to do our dev work, the timer shoujld show us when that will expire and evne provide an optional way to refresh our token - because if we try to sync and haven't got the token we'll just fail - in fact we should not proceeed with any sync function that redquires access to the google drvie unless we have an unexpired token

5) batching of all this syncing and copyikng and audio processing and audio extraction and eventually transcrioption - will all be part of this and should be considered from the get go

6) all of this should be thought through carefully and presented in a logical order in the dashboard because I will be coming to it regularly to check on syncikng and to process any new material -

Given that synching with multiple folders is the foundation of our efforts this sync dashboard is really important.  All of these materials processed and generated will be later presented in a special presentation layer which we will design once we have all the elements

5) Just a refresher on what we do with syncing
a) it allows us to access the content of files, for docx files we use mammoth and for txt files I think you read them direclty.   
b) however we have various strategies once we get the content extracted and it varies by mime-type
c) once we have fouind new files that aren't in sources_google we have to make new records for them
d) we then need to apply our ai classification prompt that figures out which document type they are and updates the sources_google record with that informatoin.  Once it is done we don't need to redo it, and to start with it is jusrt for docx files and txt files, but eventually we will do it for pdfs
e) for m4a files that already exist on the google drive - we need to copy them locally on our dev machine from the google drive - then we will process them to get ai summaries of the videos they hold the audio for - this is the audio processing we'll be doing in our python code 
f) for mp4 files that don't have an associated m4a file we'll need to copy them temporarily (just a few at a time) and temporarily store them locally.  Then we will extract the m4a file from them so we can make the ai assisstend summaries from the videos.  I don't know whether it makes sense to copy these m4a files to the google drive after we created them locally as it would save having to do the ffmpeg extraction from the mp4 file in the future once it is done.  Also, long term storage of mp4 files in particular - but even m4a files might not be advisable - wherease we can always just read them from teh google drive  
g) all of this will use batching for the processing - and there are processing tables you have ready to use for this, and we have created all the enums and the ui will need to support this
h) just to know that after we get all the m4a files procedssed, and the ai summaries created we will return to the mp4s and create full blown transcrioptions which will require high quality audio and diaraization and intensive gpu and cpu processing if possible (and of course done proably in python).  Also there are speaker files which will be needed to sync the speakers to the transcripot so we can then process them with sophisticated ai to extract out content to go along with the video presentations - by the sync dashboard I don't think should do this last transcerioptoin processing - that will be a separte page in the app deciated to creating those cleaned and ai processed transcriptions. So you deon't need to do anything on that on the sync page for now


Let me know what else you need to know to imropve the layout and design to make it more intutive and follow the steps required.  When you redo things, try veryh hard to not break functionality if you can.







there are certain functions I need in cclassifying - here they are.  1) from the newly synced files - apply the ai to them that classifies them if they aren't calssified - right now it is just for docx files and txt files - but more will be later.   THen for any that are prsentation documents I need to run sojmething that will extract the content out - I think it is mammoth in the case of docx files and perhaps just reading the txt file from the google drive for text files, but in both cases I need to put the content into  expert_documents records and then run the ai that is specific for extracting expert json info from presentation announement documents only - and write them out to the processed_documents field if they are not alrady there, and skip if they are.

Also I need to be able to add new  document types as needed and have them show up as soon as I add them.  I like seeing all the document types at the bottom , but they could use pills based on their cateogry field so I could filter to just those that I wanted to see at a given tome.  

Some of these new document types will be json based to extract the less sturctured json into the processed_contents field and I will be needing additional document types such as these as new prompts are  created that are specific to certain document types.

I need a status of processed versus unprocssed documents from the sources_google table, but then I also need a status on the ai procssed fields that have expert_documents that have been ai processed and their new document type associated.  I guess I need this classify page to be a dashboard that helps me manage all my document classification needs - and I keep discovering them

I need a better way to organize this functionality as I will always be classifying files once I get them synced from the google drive and then subsets will be further processed by ai according to their document type

Let me know what else you need to know to imropve the layout and design to make it more intutive and follow the steps required - you have the screen shot of all the buttons I've created so far, but it is quite messy now.  When you redo things, try veryh hard to not break functionality if you can.
