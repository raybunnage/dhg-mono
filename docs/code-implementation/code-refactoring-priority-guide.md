## Recommended Refactoring Approach

### Phase 1: High Priority Services
1. Start with the **FileSystemService** as it appears to be the most widely used and has significant complexity in multiple components
2. Follow with **DatabaseAccessService** to standardize data access patterns
3. Implement **GoogleDriveIntegrationService** to centralize external API interactions

### Phase 2: Extract Reusable UI Components
1. Create a shared component library starting with the most commonly used components
2. Focus on file tree, file viewers, and diagnostic displays
3. Standardize loading states and error displays

### Phase 3: Implement Support Services
1. Add **LoggingAndDiagnosticsService** to improve debugging capabilities
2. Implement **AuthenticationService** to standardize user authentication
3. Create **AIProcessingService** to centralize AI interactions

### Phase 4: Complete the Ecosystem
1. Add **ConfigurationService** for centralized configuration management
2. Implement **ErrorHandlingService** for standardized error handling
3. Create any additional utility services identified during earlier phases

## Pages to Start With

Based on complexity and shared functionality, here's the recommended order for refactoring:

1. **Viewer/Viewer2 Pages**: These components contain complex file system logic that could benefit multiple pages
2. **Supabase Integration**: Centralizing database access would provide immediate benefits
3. **Gmail Integration**: Extracting Google API interactions would simplify multiple components
4. **AI-related Pages**: Standardizing AI interactions would improve functionality across several pages

## Implementation Notes

- Create clear interfaces for all services to ensure consistent usage
- Add comprehensive documentation for each service
- Implement unit tests for core functionality
- Consider using TypeScript for better type safety and code documentation
- Use modular design to allow services to be used independently
- Consider performance implications, especially for file system operations on large directories
- Add telemetry to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

This guide should provide a clear roadmap for refactoring your codebase to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and create reusable services that can be shared across multiple pages and components.
