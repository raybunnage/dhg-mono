- [x] Update ExpertList to use adapted services
- [x] Update ExpertDetailView to use adapted services

### Utility Components

- [x] Create BatchProcessButton using adapters
- [ ] Update existing utility components to use adapters

## Documentation

- [x] Document service adapter pattern
- [x] Create testing strategy document
- [x] Create migration checklist (this document)
- [x] Create expert service refactoring plan
- [ ] Update README with new architecture
- [ ] Document shared services interfaces for future implementation

## Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for document pipeline adapter
- [ ] Write unit tests for content service
- [ ] Write unit tests for script pipeline adapter
- [ ] Write unit tests for expert service adapter
- [ ] Write integration tests for components with adapters
- [ ] Run manual testing on all key flows
- [ ] Performance testing on batch operations

## Shared Services Transition (Phase 2)

- [ ] Create shared document-pipeline-service package
- [ ] Create shared content-service package
- [ ] Create shared script-pipeline-service package
- [ ] Create shared expert-service package
- [ ] Update adapters to use shared services
- [ ] Remove temporary implementations
- [ ] End-to-end testing with shared services

## Pre-Archive Checklist

Before archiving old service implementations:

- [ ] All components use service/adapter abstractions (no direct db/api calls)
- [ ] All adapter interfaces match shared service interfaces
- [ ] The app has comprehensive tests for the functionality using the services
- [ ] All tests pass with the new shared services
- [ ] Production monitoring confirms no new errors
- [ ] Performance metrics show acceptable performance

## Archive Process

1. **Document the Archive**
   - [ ] Create documentation of what is being archived
   - [ ] Document the new locations of functionality
   - [ ] Update any external documentation

2. **Archive the Code**
   - [ ] Move files to _archive directory with date suffix
   - [ ] Keep the original structure within the archive
   - [ ] Include a README in the archive explaining the change

3. **Update References**
   - [ ] Remove imports from archived files
   - [ ] Update build configurations to exclude archived files
