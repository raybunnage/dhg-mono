     # Service Adapter Pattern for Shared Services
     ## Overview
     The Service Adapter Pattern is being used in our application to facilitate the migration
      from direct database/API calls to shared services. This document explains the pattern,
     its benefits, and implementation guidelines.
     ## The Problem
     When migrating to shared services, we face several challenges:
     ... (+150 lines)

⏺ I've continued with the incremental fixing and refactoring approach, focusing on adding more
   abstraction and improving the application's architecture:

  1. Created a ContentService:
    - Abstracts document content retrieval functionality
    - Provides consistent error handling and type safety
    - Supports batch processing of documents
  2. Added batch processing capability:
    - Created a BatchProcessButton component using the adapter pattern
    - Leverages the DocumentPipelineAdapter for document processing
    - Provides progress feedback during batch operations
  3. Refactored the GetContentButton component:
    - Now uses the ContentService instead of direct Supabase calls
    - Improved error handling and user feedback
    - Modern UI with better loading states
  4. Added comprehensive documentation:
    - Created service-adapter-pattern.md explaining the design pattern
    - Updated the experts-migration-plan.md with new services
    - Added detailed implementation examples

  These changes continue to move the application toward using shared services while
  maintaining functionality. The adapter pattern makes it easy to eventually replace the
  temporary implementations with the real shared services without changing the component
  interface.

  We're making good progress on the migration path. The next steps would include adding unit
  tests for these services and extending the adapter pattern to more components.

I've continued with the incremental refactoring approach, making significant progress on the
   migration path:

  1. Created adapter patterns for shared services:
    - Implemented a DocumentPipelineAdapter that mimics the interface of the shared
  document-pipeline-service
    - Added a ScriptPipelineAdapter with a compatible interface to the shared
  script-pipeline-service
    - Updated the ExpertDocumentDetail component to use the new document pipeline adapter
  2. Enhanced the documentation:
    - Updated the experts-migration-plan.md to reflect our progress
    - Created shared-packages-transition.md with a detailed guide for transitioning
    - Added migration-checklist.md with guidelines for determining when to finalize migration
  3. Implemented a temporary document processing service:
    - This allows testing document processing functionality without shared dependencies
    - Designed to be easily replaced by the real shared service later

  This approach provides several benefits:
  - Components are now using adapters instead of direct service implementations
  - The adapter pattern smooths the transition to shared services
  - We can test functionality with minimal dependencies
  - The migration can proceed incrementally with minimal risk

  When you're ready to start dealing with scripts that leverage shared components, we should:
  1. Complete the adapter implementations for all shared services
  2. Update package.json and tsconfig.json to include shared dependencies
  3. Modify the adapters to use the real shared services instead of the temporary
  implementations

  As for archiving old functionality, the migration-checklist.md document provides detailed
  guidelines. Generally, we should only archive after:
  - All components have been migrated to use adapters/shared services
  - Comprehensive testing confirms functionality works correctly
  - The system has been running in production with the new services for an appropriate time
  - Metrics show the system is stable and performing well

# Transitioning to Shared Packages

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for transitioning our monorepo applications from using local services to the centralized shared packages. This transition is being done incrementally to minimize risk and allow for proper testing.

## Current Progress

| Service                | Status           | Next Step                      |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| file-service           | In shared package| Update imports in apps         |
| supabase-service       | In shared package| Update imports in apps         |
| report-service         | In shared package| Update imports in apps         |
| document-pipeline      | In shared package| Create app-specific adapters   |
| script-pipeline        | In shared package| Create app-specific adapters   |

## Transition Strategy

### Phase 1: Abstraction Layer (Completed)

We've successfully created abstraction layers in applications that:
- Abstract direct database calls through service classes
- Provide consistent error handling 
- Use typed interfaces for all data
- Follow consistent patterns across the codebase

### Phase 2: Adapter Layer (Current)

The adapter layer provides a bridge between application-specific code and the shared services:

```typescript
// Example adapter for document processing
import { documentPipelineService } from '@dhg/shared/services/document-pipeline';
import { ExpertDocument } from '@/types/expert';

export class DocumentProcessingAdapter {
  // Map app-specific types to shared types
  async processDocument(document: ExpertDocument): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      // Call shared service with adapted parameters
      const result = await documentPipelineService.executeCommand(
        'process-single', 
        document.id
      );
      
      return result === 0;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing document:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

Key benefits of the adapter approach:
1. Isolates shared service dependencies 
2. Handles type conversions
3. Provides app-specific error handling
4. Creates a single point for future updates

### Phase 3: Direct Integration

Once adapters are stable, we can gradually replace them with direct imports:

```typescript
import { documentPipelineService } from '@dhg/shared/services/document-pipeline';

// Direct usage without adapters
documentPipelineService.executeCommand('process-single', documentId);
```

## Implementation Steps

### For Each Application

1. **Update package.json**
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@dhg/shared": "workspace:*",
     // other dependencies
   }
   ```

2. **Update tsconfig.json**
   ```json
   "compilerOptions": {
     "paths": {
       "@/*": ["./src/*"],
       "@dhg/*": ["../../packages/*"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create adapter services**
   - Create adapters for each shared service
   - Update existing components to use these adapters
   - Ensure proper error handling

4. **Create unit tests** 
   - Test adapters with mocked shared services
   - Verify behavior matches previous implementation

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test adapters with mock shared services
   - Verify error handling
   - Test type conversions

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test adapter/shared service integration
   - Verify database operations work correctly
   - Test performance with real data

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Verify cross-application functionality
   - Performance testing in production-like environment

## Example: Document Processing Adapter

```typescript
// Document processing adapter
import { documentPipelineService } from '@dhg/shared/services/document-pipeline';
import { ExpertDocument } from '@/types/expert';
import { Logger } from '@/utils/logger';

export class DocumentProcessingAdapter {
  // Process a single document
  async processDocument(document: ExpertDocument): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      Logger.debug(`Processing document: ${document.id}`);
      
      // Call the shared service
      const result = await documentPipelineService.executeCommand(
        'process-single',
        document.id
      );
      
      return result === 0;
    } catch (error) {
      Logger.error('Error processing document:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  // Process multiple documents
  async processMultipleDocuments(documentIds: string[]): Promise<number> {
    try {
      Logger.debug(`Processing ${documentIds.length} documents`);
      
      // Call the shared service
      const result = await documentPipelineService.executeCommand(
        'process-batch',
        ...documentIds
      );
      
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      Logger.error('Error processing documents:', error);
      return -1;
    }
  }
}
```

## Rollback Strategy

If issues occur with shared services:

1. Revert to using the local service implementations
2. Disable the shared service specific functionality
3. Document the issue in detail 
4. Create a fix in isolation
5. Test the fix thoroughly before attempting to reintegrate

## Documentation Requirements

For each shared service:

1. Document public API and type interfaces
2. Include usage examples for common scenarios
3. Document error handling and logging
4. Document implementation details and dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Create adapters for document-pipeline and script-pipeline services
2. Update package.json and tsconfig.json in each app
3. Create tests for adapters
4. Gradually replace direct database calls with shared services
