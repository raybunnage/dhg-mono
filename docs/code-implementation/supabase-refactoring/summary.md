# Supabase Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactoring

We have successfully refactored key parts of the codebase to use the SupabaseClientService singleton pattern. Here's what we accomplished:

1. **Shared Services**:
   - Updated `DatabaseService`, `DocumentService`, and `DocumentTypeService` in `scripts/cli-pipeline/shared/services/` to use the SupabaseClientService singleton
   - Removed direct client creation in these services
   - Maintained same interfaces and functionality while improving code quality

2. **CLI Scripts**:
   - Refactored `prompt-lookup.ts` in `scripts/cli-pipeline/ai/` to use SupabaseClientService
   - Updated `document-type-manager.ts` in `scripts/cli-pipeline/document/` to use SupabaseClientService
   - Refactored `analyze-script.ts` in `scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/` to use SupabaseClientService
   - Replaced direct client creation with singleton pattern in these scripts

3. **PromptService**:
   - Updated the PromptService to use SupabaseClientService instead of direct implementation
   - Simplified connection management and credential handling
   - Maintained full functionality with better code organization

4. **Frontend Client**:
   - Created a frontend-compatible SupabaseClientService in `apps/dhg-improve-experts/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing code through re-exports
   - Improved credential management in the frontend codebase

5. **Archiving**:
   - Created `.archive_supabase/` directories across the codebase to store original implementations
   - Archived files with timestamp suffixes to maintain history
   - Ensured all original implementations are preserved for reference

## Additional Files Refactored

We have completed refactoring more files to use the SupabaseClientService:

1. **Frontend Services** in `apps/dhg-improve-experts/src/services/`:
   - `documentationService.ts` - Replaced direct client creation with singleton
   - `googleDriveService.ts` - Updated multiple methods to use existing singleton client

2. **Utility Scripts** in `apps/dhg-improve-experts/src/utils/`:
   - `google-drive-roots.ts` - Removed unnecessary direct imports

3. Document-related scripts in `scripts/cli-pipeline/document/`:
   - `document-summary-report.ts` - Replaced direct client creation
   - `document-service.ts` - Updated to use SupabaseClientService
   - `sync-markdown-files.ts` - Already using SupabaseClientService
   - `standalone-document-service.ts` - Already using SupabaseClientService

4. Additional CLI scripts in `scripts/cli-pipeline/scripts/`:
   - `check-active-scripts-view.ts` - Now uses SupabaseClientService
   - `classify-script-with-prompt.ts` - Updated to use SupabaseClientService
   - `direct-db-sync.ts` - Replaced direct client creation with singleton pattern

5. Google Sync scripts in `scripts/cli-pipeline/google_sync/`:
   - `classify-missing-docs.ts` - Removed dynamic require and fallback logic

6. **Test Files**:
   - Archived `test-fixed-client.ts` which used direct client creation
   - Kept `test-client-service.ts` as it properly uses the singleton pattern

## Current Status

âœ… All identified files have been successfully refactored to use the SupabaseClientService singleton pattern.

The refactoring process included:
1. Identifying all files using direct Supabase client creation
2. Updating code to use the SupabaseClientService singleton pattern
3. Archiving test files that purposely used direct client creation
4. Verifying code functionality throughout

Any remaining JS scripts in the codebase that might still be using direct client creation should be identified and refactored as needed, but all main TypeScript files now use the proper singleton pattern.

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Consistent Pattern**: The codebase now follows a consistent pattern for Supabase access
2. **Improved Credentials Management**: Authentication credentials are managed in a single place
3. **Better Code Organization**: Reduced duplication and improved code maintainability
4. **Easier Troubleshooting**: Problems with Supabase connectivity can be diagnosed in one place
5. **Future-Proof**: Changes to authentication or connection logic can be made in one place

## Next Steps

1. Complete refactoring of remaining scripts
2. Add more comprehensive connection testing and error handling
3. Consider adding more advanced features to SupabaseClientService like connection pooling or retry logic
4. Update documentation to emphasize the importance of using the singleton pattern
