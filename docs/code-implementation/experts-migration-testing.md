# Testing Strategy for Experts Module Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for verifying the successful migration of the Experts module from direct database calls to the service abstraction layer and eventually to shared services.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Service Abstraction Testing (Current)

#### Manual Testing Checklist

| Feature | Test Cases | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Expert List | - Load experts<br>- Filter experts<br>- Select expert | ✅ |
| Expert Detail | - View expert details<br>- View enhanced profile | ✅ |
| Expert Form | - Create new expert<br>- Update existing expert | ✅ |
| Document List | - Load documents<br>- Filter documents<br>- Select document | ✅ |
| Document Detail | - View document details<br>- Toggle processed view | ✅ |
| Document Form | - Create new document<br>- Update existing document | ✅ |

#### Focused Areas for Testing

1. **Data Consistency**: Verify that data displayed before and after migration matches
2. **Error Handling**: Confirm that errors are properly caught and displayed to users
3. **State Management**: Check that component state is correctly updated
4. **Performance**: Observe any performance changes in data loading

### Phase 2: Shared Services Testing

#### Automated Tests to Implement

```typescript
// Example test for expert service
describe('ExpertService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock Supabase client or set up test database
  });
  
  it('should retrieve a list of experts', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should create a new expert', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  // Additional tests
});
```

#### Integration Tests

1. Cross-module interactions
2. Event propagation between components
3. State synchronization across the application

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing

1. Complete user flows from login to expert management
2. Boundary conditions and edge cases
3. Performance benchmarking

## Testing Environment

### Development Testing

- Local development database
- Mocked services where appropriate
- Manual verification of UI flows

### Staging/QA Testing

- Integration with real backend services
- Data migration verification
- Cross-browser testing

## Acceptance Criteria

For each component migration:

1. All functionality works as before
2. No regressions in other parts of the application
3. Performance is maintained or improved
4. Error handling is comprehensive

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after migration:

1. Revert to previous implementation
2. Document specific issues encountered
3. Develop fixes in isolation
4. Retry migration with fixes applied

## Documentation Requirements

Each test should document:

1. Test scenario and expectations
2. Test data requirements
3. Specific edge cases covered
4. Any known limitations

## Test Reporting

Results should be documented in a structured format:

```
Component: ExpertList
Test Date: 2025-03-28
Tester: [Name]
Status: ✅ Passed / ❌ Failed

Test Cases:
- Loading experts: ✅
- Filtering: ✅
- Selecting: ✅

Issues Identified:
- None

Notes:
- Performance improved by approximately 20% for large lists
```

## Final Validation

Before considering the migration complete, these checks must pass:

1. All unit and integration tests pass
2. Manual testing checklist is completed
3. Performance benchmarks meet or exceed pre-migration baselines
4. Documentation is updated to reflect new architecture
