# Service Dependency Mapping System - Phase 2 Implementation

**Date**: January 7, 2025
**Branch**: development
**Task**: Complete Phase 2 of Service Dependency Mapping System

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the Service Dependency Mapping System, adding comprehensive analysis capabilities to identify service usage patterns, find unused services, and discover pipeline integration gaps.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New CLI Commands Created

Created 4 new commands in the registry pipeline (`scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/`):

#### a. analyze-dependencies Command
- **File**: `analyze-dependencies.ts`
- **Purpose**: Scans all apps and CLI pipelines for service imports
- **Features**:
  - Recursively scans TypeScript/JavaScript files
  - Tracks which apps/pipelines use each service
  - Stores results in `service_dependencies` table
  - Handles both direct imports and @shared/adapters imports

#### b. find-unused Command
- **File**: `find-unused.ts`
- **Purpose**: Identifies services with no dependencies
- **Features**:
  - Compares all services against dependency data
  - Calculates usage statistics
  - Outputs list of unused services for potential cleanup

#### c. generate-report Command
- **File**: `generate-report.ts`
- **Purpose**: Creates comprehensive analysis reports
- **Features**:
  - Shows all services with their dependents
  - Groups by usage count
  - Highlights unused services
  - Provides actionable insights

#### d. find-pipeline-gaps Command
- **File**: `find-pipeline-gaps.ts`
- **Purpose**: Finds services used in apps but not in CLI pipelines
- **Features**:
  - Identifies integration opportunities
  - Prioritizes by app usage count
  - Helps guide CLI pipeline development

### 2. Technical Improvements

#### Enhanced Import Parser
- **File**: `utils/import-parser.ts`
- Fixed to recognize `@shared/adapters` imports
- Now correctly identifies adapter dependencies
- Handles various import patterns more robustly

#### TypeScript Configuration
- **File**: `tsconfig.json`
- Added registry pipeline directory to include paths
- Ensures proper compilation of new commands

### 3. Analysis Results

#### Dependency Statistics
- **Total Services**: 37
- **Services with Dependencies**: 11 (30%)
- **Unused Services**: 33 (89%)
- **Total Dependencies Found**: 50

#### High-Priority Pipeline Gaps
1. **google-drive-explorer-service** (4 apps use it, 0 pipelines)
   - Used by: dhg-admin-code, dhg-admin-google, dhg-admin-suite, dhg-improve-experts
   - Priority candidate for CLI pipeline integration

#### Most Used Services
1. **supabase-adapter** (7 dependents)
2. **claude-service** (5 dependents)
3. **document-type-service** (4 dependents)
4. **google-drive-explorer-service** (4 dependents)

### 4. Database Schema

Created new table for tracking dependencies:
```sql
CREATE TABLE service_dependencies (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  service_name text NOT NULL,
  dependent_type text NOT NULL,
  dependent_name text NOT NULL,
  import_path text,
  file_path text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Key Findings

1. **High Unused Service Rate**: 89% of services are not currently being used, indicating significant cleanup opportunities

2. **Adapter Success**: The supabase-adapter is the most widely used service, validating the cross-environment adapter pattern

3. **Pipeline Integration Gap**: Several services heavily used in apps (like google-drive-explorer) have no CLI pipeline integration

4. **Import Pattern Diversity**: Successfully handling various import patterns including direct imports, barrel exports, and adapter patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Consider archiving or removing unused services
   - Create CLI pipeline integration for google-drive-explorer-service
   - Document why certain services exist but are unused

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add tracking for service method usage (not just imports)
   - Create automated cleanup suggestions
   - Build service dependency visualization
   - Add periodic analysis to CI/CD pipeline

## Commands Usage

```bash
# Analyze all dependencies
./scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/registry-cli.sh analyze-dependencies

# Find unused services
./scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/registry-cli.sh find-unused

# Generate comprehensive report
./scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/registry-cli.sh generate-report

# Find pipeline integration gaps
./scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/registry-cli.sh find-pipeline-gaps
```

## Technical Notes

- All commands follow the established CLI pipeline patterns
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Database operations use singleton SupabaseClientService
- TypeScript types properly defined for all operations
- Commands integrated into registry-cli.sh wrapper

This implementation provides the foundation for systematic service management and cleanup efforts across the monorepo.
