# Git History Analysis Server Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Task**: #aaa3a0a1-a052-41a0-89a1-e2999dc3b7e2  
**Worktree**: feature/improve-prompt-service-add-page  

## Summary

Implemented a Git History Analysis Server to provide a web interface and API for analyzing git commit history and automatically assigning worktrees to completed tasks.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Server Implementation
- **File**: `scripts/cli-pipeline/dev_tasks/git-history-server.js`
- **Port**: 3011 (configurable via GIT_HISTORY_PORT)
- **Features**:
  - Web interface with visual dashboard
  - REST API endpoints for history analysis
  - Integration with assign-worktrees CLI command
  - Real-time metrics and statistics

### 2. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/analyze-history` - Analyze git commit patterns
- `POST /api/assign-worktrees` - Run automatic worktree assignment
- `GET /api/worktree-stats` - Get per-worktree task statistics

### 3. Integration Points
- Added to `start-all-servers.js` for centralized management
- Integrated into dev-tasks CLI pipeline: `./dev-tasks-cli.sh git-history-server`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with port assignment (3011)
- Command registry updated and synced

### 4. Documentation
- Created `docs/continuously-updated/git-history-analysis-server.md`
- Comprehensive guide with usage, configuration, and architecture
- Set for daily review as part of continuously updated docs

## Technical Implementation

### Web Interface Features
- Metrics dashboard showing:
  - Total commits with/without Task IDs
  - Active worktrees list
  - Recent untagged commits
- One-click assignment with confidence visualization
- Real-time statistics per worktree

### Architecture Benefits
- Provides visual access to CLI functionality
- Enables quick analysis of git history patterns
- Simplifies worktree assignment process
- Tracks assignment confidence and methods

## Usage

```bash
# Start via CLI pipeline
./scripts/cli-pipeline/dev_tasks/dev-tasks-cli.sh git-history-server

# Or via central server manager
pnpm servers

# Access web interface
http://localhost:3011
```

## Related Work

This completes the worktree assignment system enhancement by providing:
1. Enhanced 3-state completion filtering in TasksPage
2. Sophisticated assignment algorithms in assign-worktrees.ts
3. Database tracking for assignment metadata
4. Web interface for easy interaction

The system now supports comprehensive git history analysis with multiple inference strategies for assigning worktrees to completed tasks without explicit Task IDs.
