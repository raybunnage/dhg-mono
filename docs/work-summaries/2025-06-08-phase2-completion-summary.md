# Package Cleanup Phase 2 Completion Summary
Date: June 8, 2025

## Phase 2 Accomplishments

### Successfully Archived packages/cli
- **Migrated** the last remaining import from `packages/cli` in `classify-script-with-prompt.ts`
- **Removed** unused FileService import (script was already using fs directly)
- **Archived** entire `packages/cli` directory to `packages/.archived_packages/cli.20250608`
- **Stats**: 59 files, 448.07 KB total size
- **Result**: Phase 2 complete - all imports migrated to shared services

## Remaining Packages Analysis

### 1. python-audio-processor
- **Purpose**: Modal.com deployment for Whisper audio processing
- **Dependencies**: modal, faster-whisper, torch, numpy, soundfile, ffmpeg-python
- **Usage**: No direct imports found in codebase
- **Recommendation**: Keep - appears to be used for Modal deployments

### 2. python-shared
- **Purpose**: Python utilities for database connections
- **Contents**: 
  - `database/supabase_client.py` - Singleton Supabase client for Python
- **Usage**: No direct imports found, but likely used by Python scripts
- **Recommendation**: Keep - provides Python Supabase connectivity

### 3. tools
- **Purpose**: NLP analysis tools for presentations
- **Contents**:
  - `nlp_presentation_analysis/` - Embedding generation, keyword extraction, entity extraction
  - `presentation_tagging/` - Presentation tagging utilities
- **Usage**: No direct imports found in codebase
- **Recommendation**: Evaluate further - may be experimental or unused

### 4. shared
- **Status**: Active and critical
- **Purpose**: Core shared services and components for the monorepo
- **Recommendation**: Keep - this is the primary shared services package

## Summary Statistics

### Archived Packages (Total: 4)
1. **cli-pipeline** - 3 files, 16.82 KB (Phase 1)
2. **dal** - 7 files, 1.00 KB (Phase 1)
3. **modal** - 1 file, 4.23 KB (Phase 1)
4. **cli** - 59 files, 448.07 KB (Phase 2)

**Total Archived**: 70 files, 488.12 KB

### Active Packages (Total: 4)
1. **shared** - Core shared services (critical)
2. **python-audio-processor** - Modal audio processing
3. **python-shared** - Python database utilities
4. **tools** - NLP analysis tools (needs evaluation)

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate tools package** - Determine if NLP analysis tools are actively used
2. **Document Python packages** - Add README files explaining their purpose
3. **Consider consolidation** - Python packages might be consolidated into a single Python utilities package

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner structure** - Removed 50% of packages (4 out of 8)
2. **No breaking changes** - All migrations preserved functionality
3. **Better organization** - Clear separation between active and archived packages
4. **Improved maintainability** - Developers won't accidentally use deprecated packages
