# Package Archival Phase 1 Completion Report
Date: June 8, 2025

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the package cleanup initiative, archiving 3 deprecated packages from the `/packages` directory.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Database Infrastructure
- Created `sys_archived_package_files` table to track archived package files
- Applied migration: `20250608000001_create_sys_archived_package_files.sql`
- Table includes metadata: package name, file paths, file types, sizes, and archive reasons

### 2. Archived Packages

| Package | Files | Size | Reason |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| cli-pipeline | 3 | 16.82 KB | Nearly empty, no active imports found |
| dal | 7 | 1.00 KB | Deprecated Python utilities, no usage found |
| modal | 1 | 4.23 KB | Single file, functionality exists elsewhere |

**Total**: 3 packages, 11 files, 22.04 KB

### 3. Archive Location
- Created `/packages/.archived_packages/` directory
- Each package archived with timestamp: `{package-name}.20250608`
- Added `.archived_packages/` to `.gitignore`

### 4. Database Tracking
All archived files are tracked in `sys_archived_package_files` with:
- Original and archived file paths
- File types and sizes
- Archive timestamp and reason
- Zero dependencies (confirmed no active usage)

## Scripts Created

1. **`archive-packages.ts`** - Main archival script that:
   - Moves packages to archive directory
   - Tracks all files in database
   - Preserves directory structure

2. **`check-archived-packages.ts`** - Summary reporting script

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: CLI Package Migration
- Migrate remaining services from `packages/cli` to `packages/shared/services`
- Update 9 files still importing from packages/cli:
  - presentations pipeline (5 files)
  - scripts pipeline (1 file)
  - document pipeline (3 files)
- Archive `packages/cli` once migration complete

### Phase 3: Python Package Evaluation
- Verify usage of `python-audio-processor`
- Check dependencies on `python-shared`
- Evaluate `tools` package purpose

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Package Structure**: Removed 3 unused packages
2. **Historical Tracking**: All archived files tracked in database for reference
3. **Reduced Confusion**: Developers won't accidentally use deprecated packages
4. **Improved Build Performance**: Fewer packages to process
