**Date**: 2025-06-11
**Category**: feature
**Tags**: dev-tasks, lifecycle-tracking, database, cli-pipeline
**Task**: #ad70b041-96ca-45c8-89bf-c8a90baf7ae6

## Summary

Implemented the comprehensive dev task lifecycle tracking system as specified in the V2 specification document. This system provides complete tracking of work summaries, validation results, test outcomes, and follow-up tasks with automated todo generation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements
- Created migration `20250611_complete_dev_task_lifecycle_tracking.sql` adding:
  - `work_summary_todos` table for tracking todos linked to work summaries
  - `task_todo_templates` table with default todo templates
  - Enhanced `work_summary_tracking_view` with comprehensive tracking metrics
  - `create_work_summary_with_task_link` function for automated todo generation
  - RLS policies for all new tables

### 2. Service Layer Implementation
- Created `LifecycleTrackingMixin` class with methods for:
  - Creating work summaries with automatic todo generation
  - Managing work summary todos (toggle completion)
  - Recording validation submissions
  - Tracking test execution results
  - Retrieving comprehensive tracking information
- Enhanced `DevTaskService` to include lifecycle tracking functionality

### 3. CLI Pipeline Integration
- Added four new commands to dev-tasks-cli:
  - `create-summary`: Create work summary linked to task with auto-generated todos
  - `track-validation`: Record validation results with issue tracking
  - `track-tests`: Record test execution with coverage metrics
  - `show-tracking`: Display comprehensive tracking information
- Updated `dev-tasks-cli.sh` shell script with new commands and examples

### 4. Documentation
- Created living documentation at `docs/living-docs/dev-task-lifecycle-tracking-system.md`
- Documented architecture, features, CLI usage, and database schema

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Fixed TypeScript interface issues for `WorkSummaryTracking`
- Removed unnecessary field updates in validation/test commands
- Successfully tested all CLI commands with real data

## Technical Details

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Mixin Pattern**: Used a mixin class to keep lifecycle tracking separate but accessible
2. **Auto-generated Todos**: System automatically creates todos from templates when work summaries are created
3. **View-based Tracking**: Used PostgreSQL view for comprehensive tracking metrics
4. **Function-based Creation**: Database function ensures atomic creation of work summaries with todos

### Database View Structure
The `work_summary_tracking_view` provides:
- Work summary details (title, content, timestamps)
- Todo progress metrics (total, completed, percentage)
- Validation status and counts
- Test results and coverage
- Follow-up task tracking
- Action-required indicators

## Verification

Tested the implementation by:
1. Creating a work summary for the current task
2. Recording validation results (passed)
3. Recording test results (8 tests, 100% pass rate, 85.5% coverage)
4. Viewing comprehensive tracking information

All commands executed successfully and data is properly stored in the database.

## Next Steps

1. Create UI components for lifecycle tracking (as described in V2 spec)
2. Add more sophisticated todo templates based on task types
3. Implement automated validation triggers
4. Add more comprehensive test result parsing
