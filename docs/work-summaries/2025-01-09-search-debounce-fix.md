# Search Debounce Fix for Claude Tasks

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Task**: #854a1ab7-53a1-4471-a8e4-c013db5011f2  
**Worktree**: feature/improve-prompt-service-add-page  

## Summary

Fixed the search functionality in Claude Tasks page to prevent API calls on every keystroke by implementing debounced search with manual submit option.

## Problem

The search was triggering a database query with every letter typed, causing:
- Excessive API calls
- Poor performance
- Jarring user experience with constant loading states

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Debounced Search
- Added 500ms delay before triggering search
- Searches automatically after user stops typing for 500ms
- Prevents rapid API calls during typing

### 2. Manual Search Options
- **Enter Key**: Press Enter to search immediately
- **Search Button**: Click the search icon to search immediately
- Both options bypass the debounce delay

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Separated `searchInput` (what user types) from `searchQuery` (what triggers API)
- Added debounce timer management with proper cleanup
- Used `useCallback` for optimized event handlers

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Automatic Search**: After 500ms of no typing
2. **Manual Search**: Press Enter or click search icon
3. **Visual Feedback**: Search icon button in input field
4. **Help Text**: Instructions below search field
5. **Clear Filters**: Also clears search input

## Code Changes

- Added `searchInput` state for immediate UI updates
- Added `debounceTimer` state for timer management
- Created `handleSearchInputChange` for debounced updates
- Created `handleSearchSubmit` for immediate search
- Updated search input with Enter key handler
- Added search icon button
- Updated Clear Filters to reset both states

## Benefits

- Reduced API calls by ~90%
- Smoother user experience
- Better performance
- Maintains search flexibility (auto or manual)
