# Phase 2 Progress Summary

## Key Discovery

**PromptQueryService in packages/cli is LEGACY CODE** - The same functionality already exists in `packages/shared/services/prompt-service` with these methods:
- `getPromptByName()` 
- `loadPrompt()` (equivalent to `getPromptWithQueryResults()`)
- `executeQuery()`

## Test Migration Results

Successfully tested migration on `check-prompt.ts`:
- ‚úÖ Import updated from PromptQueryService to PromptService
- ‚úÖ Service instantiation updated
- ‚úÖ Method call updated (with minor manual fix for return format)
- ‚úÖ File compiles without errors

## Decision Point

Given the complexity and need for manual fixes, I recommend:

### Option 1: Full Automated Migration (Higher Risk)
- Run the migration script on all 10 files
- Manually fix each file for return format changes
- Test all pipelines
- Pros: Faster completion
- Cons: Multiple files could break at once

### Option 2: Incremental Migration (Recommended)
- Migrate one pipeline at a time
- Test after each pipeline
- Fix issues as they arise
- Pros: Safer, easier to rollback
- Cons: Takes longer

### Option 3: Keep packages/cli Temporarily
- Update imports to use shared services where possible
- Keep packages/cli for now
- Gradually phase it out
- Pros: No breaking changes
- Cons: Delayed cleanup

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: 3 packages archived
- üîÑ Phase 2 In Progress: Migration strategy validated
- ‚è≥ Awaiting decision on migration approach

## Files Requiring Migration

**9 files total** (excluding the one already done):
- 5 in presentations pipeline
- 3 in document pipeline  
- 1 in scripts pipeline

Each file needs:
1. Import updates
2. Service instantiation updates
3. Return format handling
4. Error handling updates (remove ErrorHandler)
5. Config removal (for document pipeline)
