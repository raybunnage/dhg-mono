Date: June 8, 2025

Author: Claude Assistant

## Summary

Completed final migration cleanup for CLI pipeline scripts that were still importing from the archived `packages/cli`. These scripts were missed in the initial migration phases but are now properly updated to use shared services.

## Main Changes and Purpose

### Purpose
- Complete the package migration by updating remaining imports
- Ensure all CLI pipeline scripts use shared services
- Remove dependency on archived packages/cli
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

### Changes Made
1. **Updated imports** from `packages/cli` to `packages/shared` in 7 CLI pipeline scripts
2. **Added migration utility** script for future reference
3. **Fixed TypeScript types** to use proper Supabase client types

import { SupabaseClientService } from '../../packages/cli/src/services/supabase-client';

import { Logger } from '../../../packages/shared/utils/logger';
import { SupabaseClientService } from '../../../packages/shared/services/supabase-client';
```
