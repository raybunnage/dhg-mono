# Follow-Up Task Tracking Implementation

## Date: 2025-06-11

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive follow-up task tracking system that allows dev tasks and work summaries to display their follow-up implementation tasks. This creates better visibility into the progress of feature implementations and ensures users stay informed about ongoing work.

## Task Reference
- **Dev Task ID**: b9cd0107-0a7d-47d3-9e21-b25a49b47bf2
- **Title**: Create follow-up task tracking display
- **Worktree**: feature/improve-prompt-service-add-page

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Implementation
- Created `dev_follow_up_tasks` table to store relationships between original tasks/summaries and their follow-ups
- Added two views for efficient querying:
  - `dev_follow_up_tasks_with_details_view`: Shows follow-up tasks with their details
  - `dev_original_tasks_with_follow_ups_view`: Shows original tasks with their follow-ups
- Implemented PostgreSQL functions:
  - `create_follow_up_task_relationship`: Creates relationships with proper validation
  - `get_follow_ups`: Retrieves follow-up information for a given task

### 2. Component Development
- **CreateTaskFromPhase.tsx**: Enhanced to support creating follow-up relationships when tasks are generated from phase implementations
- **FollowUpInfoDisplay.tsx**: New component that displays follow-up information at the top of task detail pages
- **FollowUpTasksSummary.tsx**: Component for displaying multiple follow-up tasks in a summary format
- **CreateFollowUpModal.tsx**: Modal interface for creating follow-up relationships through the UI
- **TaskDetailPage.tsx**: Integrated the FollowUpInfoDisplay component to show follow-up information

### 3. Type Safety
- Updated TypeScript types after database migration
- Fixed all type errors related to the new schema
- Ensured proper type inference for RPC function calls

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in LivingDocsPage.tsx
- Resolved PostgreSQL function parameter ordering issues
- Fixed unused import warnings

## Technical Details

### Database Design
The system uses a junction table pattern that allows:
- A follow-up task to be linked to either a dev_task OR a work_summary
- Multiple follow-up types (implementation, bugfix, enhancement, refactoring, documentation)
- Tracking of creation metadata and optional summaries

### Key Implementation Decisions
1. Used CHECK constraints to ensure a follow-up is linked to exactly one original item
2. Created database views to simplify querying and reduce join complexity
3. Implemented RLS policies for secure access control
4. Used PostgreSQL RPC functions for complex operations to ensure data integrity

## Testing and Verification
- Successfully applied database migration using psql
- Verified all components query the database correctly
- Tested follow-up creation through CreateTaskFromPhase component
- Confirmed follow-up information displays properly on task detail pages

## Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/20250611_add_follow_up_tracking.sql` (new)
- `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/components/CreateTaskFromPhase.tsx`
- `packages/shared/components/follow-up/FollowUpInfoDisplay.tsx` (new)
- `packages/shared/components/follow-up/FollowUpTasksSummary.tsx` (new)
- `packages/shared/components/follow-up/CreateFollowUpModal.tsx` (new)
- `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx`
- `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/pages/LivingDocsPage.tsx`
- `supabase/types.ts` (regenerated)

## Next Steps
The follow-up task tracking system is now fully functional. Users can:
1. Create follow-up relationships when generating tasks from phases
2. View follow-up information on task detail pages
3. Track the implementation progress of features across the system
