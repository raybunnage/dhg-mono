# Task Status Tracking Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Task**: #f867cff7-fc9d-4c9c-81fd-294783181190  
**Worktree**: feature/improve-prompt-service-add-page  

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive task status tracking and display for Claude Tasks, showing submission status, worktree information, and git commit progress.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Enhancements
Added new tracking fields to `dev_tasks` table:
- `submitted_to_claude` - Boolean flag for Claude submission
- `submitted_at` - Timestamp of submission
- `submitted_on_worktree` - Which worktree the task was submitted from
- `has_commits` - Whether any commits have been made
- `last_commit_at` - Timestamp of most recent commit
- `progress_status` - Overall progress indicator

### 2. Progress Status Types
- **not_started** - Task created but not yet worked on
- **claude_submitted** - Task has been submitted to Claude
- **in_development** - Active development in progress
- **has_commits** - Git commits have been made
- **ready_for_review** - Development complete, ready for review
- **completed** - Task is finished

### 3. TaskCard Component
Created a new `TaskCard` component that displays:
- Progress status with appropriate icons
- Submission details (when submitted, on which worktree)
- Commit information (number of commits, last commit date)
- Visual indicators for each stage of progress

### 4. Automatic Status Updates
Implemented database trigger to automatically update progress status when:
- `claude_request` is set â†’ Updates to "claude_submitted"
- `git_commits_count` > 0 â†’ Updates to "has_commits"
- `status` changes to completed/merged â†’ Updates to "completed"

## Visual Improvements

Each task card now shows:
- ðŸ“‹ **Progress Status Line**: Shows current stage with icon and description
- ðŸ“¤ **Claude Submission Info**: Date submitted and worktree used
- ðŸ’» **Git Activity**: Number of commits and last commit date
- ðŸŽ¨ **Color Coding**: Different colors for each progress stage

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
1. `supabase/migrations/20250109_add_task_submission_tracking.sql` - Database fields
2. `supabase/migrations/20250109_add_task_progress_trigger.sql` - Auto-update trigger
3. `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/components/TaskCard.tsx` - New display component
4. `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/pages/TasksPage.tsx` - Updated to use TaskCard
5. `apps/dhg-admin-code/src/services/task-service.ts` - Added new fields to interface

### Usage

The system now automatically tracks:
1. When a task is submitted to Claude
2. Which worktree it was submitted from
3. When commits are made
4. Overall progress through the development lifecycle

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: See at a glance which tasks are in progress
2. **Worktree Context**: Know which worktree each task was worked on
3. **Progress Tracking**: Understand where each task is in the workflow
4. **Automatic Updates**: Status updates automatically based on activity

## Testing

The progress trigger has been tested and automatically updates:
- Sets `submitted_to_claude` when `claude_request` is populated
- Updates `has_commits` when `git_commits_count` increases
- Changes `progress_status` based on task activity

## Future Enhancements

- Add filtering by progress status
- Show timeline of status changes
- Integration with git history server for real-time updates
- Automated worktree detection when submitting to Claude
