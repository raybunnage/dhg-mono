# Shared Services Extraction and Standardization

**Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Branch**: improve-cli-pipelines  
**Summary ID**: 303d7ed6-d66f-4dba-8c70-bba9ec936d1f

## Overview

Performed a comprehensive analysis of all applications in the monorepo to identify opportunities for code reuse through shared services. Successfully extracted common functionality into reusable services and standardized the usage of the Supabase adapter across applications.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Application Analysis
- Analyzed 9 applications: dhg-a, dhg-b, dhg-hub, dhg-hub-lovable, dhg-audio, dhg-admin-code, dhg-admin-google, dhg-admin-suite, dhg-research
- Identified common patterns and duplicate code across apps
- Found multiple custom Supabase adapter implementations that needed consolidation

### 2. New Shared Services Created

#### Environment Configuration Service (`env-config-service`)
- **Location**: `packages/shared/services/env-config-service/`
- **Features**:
  - Cross-platform environment variable management
  - Automatic detection of browser vs Node.js environment
  - Handles VITE_ prefixed variables in browser environments
  - Provides validation and diagnostics
  - Feature flag support with parsing utilities
- **Benefits**: Eliminates duplicate environment handling code across apps

#### Theme Service (`theme-service`)
- **Location**: `packages/shared/services/theme-service/`
- **Features**:
  - Unified dark/light/system theme management
  - System preference detection via media queries
  - Persistent storage using localStorage
  - Event-based updates with observer pattern
  - Multiple UI variants (button, switch, dropdown)
- **Includes**:
  - React hook: `useTheme` for easy integration
  - Shared component: `ThemeToggle` with multiple variants
- **Benefits**: Standardizes theme management across all apps

#### AI Processing Service (`ai-processing-service`)
- **Location**: `packages/shared/services/ai-processing-service/`
- **Features**:
  - Document classification with confidence scoring
  - Content analysis (sentiment, topics, language detection)
  - Data validation with detailed error reporting
  - Key information extraction (title, summary, keywords, entities)
  - Content comparison and similarity scoring
  - Content summarization with length control
- **Benefits**: Centralizes all AI operations using the Claude service

#### Google Drive Browser Service (`google-drive-browser-service`)
- **Location**: `packages/shared/services/google-drive/google-drive-browser-service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Browser-specific Google Drive operations
  - OAuth2 token-based authentication
  - File content retrieval (text, Google Docs, etc.)
  - File listing and search capabilities
  - Content cleaning for database storage
- **Benefits**: Reusable Google Drive functionality for browser environments

### 3. Application Updates

#### dhg-hub
- **Before**: Custom `supabase-browser-adapter.ts` with duplicate code
- **After**: Uses `@shared/adapters/supabase-adapter`
- **Changes**: Simplified from 289 lines to 12 lines
- Removed diagnostic methods that were causing TypeScript errors

#### dhg-admin-google
- **Before**: 
  - Custom Supabase adapter implementation
  - Local Google Drive utilities
  - Local AI processing functions
- **After**:
  - Uses universal Supabase adapter
  - Uses shared Google Drive browser service
  - Uses shared AI processing service
- **Benefits**: Reduced code duplication, improved maintainability

#### dhg-admin-code
- Already using the universal adapter correctly
- Serves as the reference implementation

### 4. Shared Exports Updated
- Updated `packages/shared/services/index.ts` to export new services
- Updated `packages/shared/index.ts` to export hooks and components
- All services now accessible via `@shared/services`

## Technical Details

### Singleton Pattern Implementation
All services use singleton pattern for resource efficiency:
```typescript
private static instance: ServiceClass;
public static getInstance(): ServiceClass {
  if (!ServiceClass.instance) {
    ServiceClass.instance = new ServiceClass();
  }
  return ServiceClass.instance;
}
```

### Cross-Environment Support
Services detect environment and adapt accordingly:
```typescript
this.isBrowser = typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.document !== 'undefined';
```

### TypeScript Integration
- Full type safety with explicit interfaces
- Proper error handling with typed exceptions
- No implicit `any` types

## Issues Discovered

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
- Many CLI pipeline scripts have shebang lines (`#!/usr/bin/env ts-node`)
- These are not valid TypeScript syntax and cause compilation errors
- Affects approximately 300+ files in `scripts/cli-pipeline/`

### Import Path Issues
- Some apps still have hardcoded import paths that need updating
- ReactMarkdown compatibility issues in some components

## Migration Path for Other Apps

To migrate remaining apps to use shared services:

1. **Replace Supabase adapters**:
   ```typescript
   import { createSupabaseAdapter } from '@shared/adapters/supabase-adapter';
   export const supabase = createSupabaseAdapter();
   ```

2. **Use environment config service**:
   ```typescript
   import { envConfig } from '@shared/services/env-config-service';
   const apiUrl = envConfig.get('API_URL');
   ```

3. **Implement theme support**:
   ```typescript
   import { useTheme } from '@shared/hooks/useTheme';
   import { ThemeToggle } from '@shared/components/theme/ThemeToggle';
   ```

4. **Leverage AI processing**:
   ```typescript
   import { aiProcessing } from '@shared/services/ai-processing-service';
   const result = await aiProcessing.classifyDocument(content, types);
   ```

## Commands Used
- `pnpm` - Package management
- `git merge` - Merged development branch
- `git push` - Pushed changes
- `grep` - Searched for patterns across codebase
- `tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation checks

## Tags

## Next Steps
1. Remove shebang lines from TypeScript files in CLI pipeline
2. Complete migration of remaining apps (dhg-hub-lovable, dhg-audio, dhg-admin-suite, dhg-research)
3. Create shared toast notification service
4. Add unit tests for new shared services
5. Update documentation for shared service usage
