# Work Summary: Proxy Server Refactoring and Industry Best Practices Analysis

**Date**: 2025-06-13
**Category**: Architecture & Infrastructure
**Tags**: proxy-servers, refactoring, best-practices, monorepo

## Overview

Completed a major refactoring of proxy servers to use a consistent base class architecture, extracting shared functionality into reusable services. Also conducted an analysis of industry best practices for monorepo development to identify potential improvements.

## Completed Work

### 1. Proxy Server Architecture Refactoring

Created a standardized proxy server infrastructure with:
- **BaseProxyServer**: Common functionality for all proxy servers
- **Service extraction**: Business logic moved to shared services
- **Consistent patterns**: Error handling, CORS, health checks

### 2. Migrated Proxy Servers

Successfully refactored the following proxy servers:

#### ContinuousDocsProxy (Port 9882)
- **Original**: `dhg-admin-code/continuous-docs-server.cjs`
- **New Service**: `ContinuousDocsService` - singleton for documentation tracking
- **Features**: Track continuously updated docs, update frequencies, manual triggers

#### AudioStreamingProxy (Port 9883)
- **Original**: `dhg-audio/server.js` and `server-enhanced.js`
- **New Service**: `AudioProxyService` - handles Google Drive audio streaming
- **Features**: Google Drive API streaming, local file support, range requests

#### GitOperationsProxy (Port 9881)
- **Original**: `dhg-admin-code/git-server.cjs`
- **New Service**: `GitOperationsService` - git operations management
- **Features**: Worktree management, branch operations, commit history

### 3. Test Infrastructure

Created test components in `dhg-service-test` app for each proxy server:
- `TestContinuousDocsProxy`
- `TestAudioStreamingProxy`
- `TestGitOperationsProxy`
- `TestFileBrowserProxy`

### 4. Cleanup

- Archived old proxy servers in `.archived_servers` directories
- Created CLI scripts for starting each proxy server
- Updated proxy-servers package exports

## Industry Best Practices Analysis

### Current Strengths
- ✅ Service-oriented architecture with proxy/service separation
- ✅ Monorepo with pnpm workspaces for code sharing
- ✅ Multi-agent worktrees for parallel development
- ✅ Living documentation system
- ✅ Dual authentication (Supabase + whitelist)
- ✅ TypeScript throughout the stack

### Identified Gaps

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Missing unit tests for services
   - No integration tests for proxy servers
   - No E2E tests for critical flows
   - No snapshot testing for React components

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - No automated testing on push
   - Missing type checking across worktrees
   - No dependency security scanning
   - Manual deployment process

3. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Using console.log instead of structured logging
   - No error tracking (Sentry)
   - Missing performance monitoring
   - No analytics for content engagement

4. **API Documentation**
   - No OpenAPI/Swagger specs
   - Missing interactive API testing
   - No auto-generated client SDKs

5. **Additional Infrastructure**
   - No feature flags system
   - Limited caching strategy
   - Basic security (no rate limiting)
   - No Docker standardization

## Recommendations

For a solo developer with medical content focus:

### Priority 1 (High Impact, Low Effort)
- **Structured Logging Service**: Replace console.log with proper logger
- **Error Tracking**: Add Sentry for production reliability
- **Basic E2E Tests**: Cover critical paths (video playback, auth)

### Priority 2 (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specs for proxy servers
- **Simple CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for type checking and deployment
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect API endpoints

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
- **Feature Flags**: For safe feature rollouts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track proxy server performance
- **Docker Containers**: Standardize development environment

## Next Steps

1. Implement base service classes architecture (as discussed)
2. Create structured logging service as first base service implementation
3. Add error tracking to critical services
4. Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Eliminated code duplication across proxy servers
- Standardized error handling and response formats
- Improved testability through service extraction
- Created consistent patterns for future proxy servers

## Impact

This refactoring provides:
- **Better maintainability**: Consistent patterns across all proxy servers
- **Improved reusability**: Services can be used in multiple contexts
- **Enhanced testability**: Services can be tested independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new proxy servers following the pattern
- **Clear roadmap**: Identified specific improvements aligned with industry standards
