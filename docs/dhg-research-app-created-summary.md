## Tables That Need Migration

Based on the analysis of `dhg-knowledge-tool-2`, these tables need to be migrated:

### Core Email Tables
1. **emails** → `email_messages` (partially exists)
   - Need to merge additional fields
   - Convert integer IDs to UUIDs

2. **email_contents** → `email_processed_contents`
   - AI-analyzed content
   - Participants, summaries, quotes

3. **email_concepts** → `email_extracted_concepts`
   - Knowledge extracted from emails
   - Categories and classifications

### URL and Content Tables
4. **all_email_urls** → `email_extracted_urls`
   - Simple URL extraction from emails

5. **urls** → `research_urls`
   - **Key table for web content**
   - Contains article metadata
   - Processing status
   - Email associations

6. **rolled_up_emails** → `email_thread_aggregations`
   - Groups similar emails
   - Pattern detection

### Supporting Tables
7. **attachments** → `email_attachments`
   - File tracking
   - Links to PDFs

8. **important_email_addresses** → `email_important_addresses`
   - Filter configuration
   - Importance levels

## Key Data to Import

### From URLs Table
The `urls` table is particularly important as it contains:
- Extracted article titles
- Author information  
- Publication dates
- Summaries
- Keywords
- Processing flags

### From Email Concepts
- Scientific concepts extracted by AI
- Categories and classifications
- Confidence scores
- Related quotes

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration (Priority)
```bash
# Create migration file
./scripts/cli-pipeline/database/database-cli.sh migration create email-tables

# Run migration
./scripts/cli-pipeline/database/database-cli.sh migration run-staged
```

### 2. Data Import Tools
Need to create:
- SQLite to PostgreSQL converter
- UUID mapping for relationships
- Data cleaning scripts
- Validation tools

### 3. Connect App to Real Data
- Replace mock data with Supabase queries
- Implement real Gmail sync
- Connect to CLI pipeline
- Add authentication

### 4. Integration Points
- Gmail CLI pipeline commands
- Shared document viewer component
- Supabase real-time updates
- AI processing queue

## Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd apps/dhg-research
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:5005`

## Configuration Needed

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

2. **Gmail Configuration**
   - Set up OAuth or service account
   - Configure in Gmail CLI pipeline

3. **Database Tables**
   - Run migration scripts
   - Import existing data
   - Set up RLS policies

## Summary

The dhg-research app provides a comprehensive interface for managing research emails with:
- Beautiful dark blue theme
- Full Gmail management capabilities
- Analytics and insights
- Ready for document viewer integration
- Prepared for real data migration

The app is ready for the next phase of connecting to real data and implementing the backend services.
