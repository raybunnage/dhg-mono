# Prompt Service Implementation Progress

*Last Updated: June 8, 2025*
*Status: Phase 1 In Progress*

## Executive Summary

The prompt service enhancement project aims to transform our basic prompt storage system into an intelligent analysis orchestrator. This document tracks implementation progress against the vision outlined in the technical specifications.

## Implementation Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) 🟡 In Progress
**Target Completion: June 15, 2025**

#### Database Schema Enhancements
- [ ] Add `prompt_type` column to `ai_prompts`
- [ ] Add `performance_metrics` JSONB column
- [ ] Add `context_requirements` JSONB column
- [ ] Create `ai_prompt_pipelines` table
- [ ] Create `ai_prompt_executions` table
- [ ] Create performance tracking indexes

#### Service Updates
- [x] Basic prompt loading from database
- [x] Filesystem fallback mechanism
- [ ] Prompt composition system
- [ ] Performance metric collection
- [ ] Execution tracking

#### Current Blockers
- Need to complete script cleanup before major schema changes
- Awaiting decision on pipeline consolidation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Weeks 3-4) 📅 Planned
**Target Start: June 16, 2025**

#### Pipeline System
- [ ] Multi-stage pipeline execution engine
- [ ] Context passing between stages
- [ ] Pipeline visualization API

#### Intelligent Selection
- [ ] Prompt scoring algorithm
- [ ] Historical performance analysis
- [ ] Cost optimization logic

#### Context System
- [ ] Dynamic context sources
- [ ] Query-based context injection
- [ ] Document aggregation

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Weeks 5-6) 📅 Future
**Target Start: June 30, 2025**

#### Concept Extraction
- [ ] `ai_extracted_concepts` table
- [ ] `ai_concept_relationships` table
- [ ] Extraction algorithms
- [ ] Relationship mapping

#### Learning Integration
- [ ] Learning path generation
- [ ] Prerequisite identification
- [ ] Progress tracking

#### Research Features
- [ ] Cross-document analysis
- [ ] Citation network building
- [ ] Collaboration tools

### Phase 4: UI Integration (Week 7) 📅 Future
**Target Start: July 14, 2025**

#### Admin Interface
- [ ] Prompt CRUD operations
- [ ] Pipeline builder
- [ ] Testing interface

#### Dashboards
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] Quality tracking

## Current Implementation Status

### What's Working Now

#### Database Layer
```sql
-- Current schema supports:
- Basic prompt storage with metadata
- Document type associations
- Category hierarchies
- Output templates
- Relationship tracking
```

#### Service Layer
```typescript
// PromptQueryService capabilities:
- Load prompts by ID or criteria
- Execute database queries within prompts
- Generate combined content for Claude
- Basic template processing
```

#### Integration Points
- UnifiedClassificationService uses prompts
- Document processing pipeline integration
- Basic mime type to prompt mapping

### What's Missing

#### Critical Gaps
1. **No execution tracking** - Can't measure performance
2. **No pipeline support** - Single prompt execution only
3. **No cost tracking** - Unknown token usage
4. **Limited context** - Static prompt content only

#### Nice-to-Have Features
1. Dynamic prompt generation
2. A/B testing framework
3. Collaborative editing
4. Version branching

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Schema Updates (Next Week)
```sql
-- Safe, backward-compatible changes
ALTER TABLE ai_prompts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS prompt_type TEXT DEFAULT 'standard';

ALTER TABLE ai_prompts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS performance_metrics JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Create new tables without breaking existing
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ai_prompt_executions (...);
```

### Step 2: Service Enhancements
```typescript
// Extend existing service, don't replace
class EnhancedPromptService extends PromptQueryService {
  // New methods while maintaining compatibility
}
```

### Step 3: Gradual Migration
1. Deploy enhanced service alongside existing
2. Migrate one document type at a time
3. Monitor performance differences
4. Complete migration after validation

## Key Decisions Needed

### Architectural Choices
1. **Monolithic vs Microservice**: Keep in shared services or separate?
2. **Sync vs Async**: Pipeline execution strategy?
3. **Storage Strategy**: JSONB vs normalized tables for metrics?

### Integration Questions
1. How to integrate with existing document pipeline?
2. Should prompts be versioned in git or database only?
3. What level of UI is needed for phase 1?

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Execution tracking for 50% of prompts
- [ ] Basic performance dashboard deployed
- [ ] No increase in response time

### Overall Project Goals
- Reduce analysis time by 50%
- Improve accuracy to >85%
- Cut token costs by 30%
- Enable multi-document analysis

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Schema migration complexity**: Mitigated by careful testing
2. **Performance degradation**: Monitor with each change
3. **Breaking changes**: Extensive compatibility testing

### Timeline Risks
1. **Script cleanup delays**: May push back schema changes
2. **Integration complexity**: Buffer time added
3. **Testing requirements**: Automated test suite needed

## Next Actions

### This Week (June 9-15)
1. Complete script cleanup phase 1
2. Draft schema migration SQL
3. Design execution tracking API
4. Create performance baseline

### Next Week (June 16-22)
1. Deploy schema updates
2. Implement execution tracking
3. Build pipeline prototype
4. Start performance collection
