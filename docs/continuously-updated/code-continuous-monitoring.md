# Code Continuous Monitoring System
## Vision & Implementation Guide

*Last Updated: June 8, 2025*

## üéØ **Vision Statement**

The **Code Continuous Monitoring System** provides automated, real-time insights into code quality, architecture patterns, and technical debt across the DHG monorepo. Unlike documentation monitoring (which tracks content freshness), code monitoring focuses on **code health, maintainability, and adherence to project standards**.

### **Core Objectives**

1. **Early Detection**: Identify code quality issues before they become technical debt
2. **Pattern Enforcement**: Ensure adherence to architectural patterns (singleton services, proper imports, etc.)
3. **Refactoring Guidance**: Suggest opportunities for shared service extraction and code improvements
4. **Trend Analysis**: Track code health metrics over time to inform technical decisions
5. **Automated Standards**: Continuously validate CLAUDE.md guidelines compliance

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Database Foundation**

The system uses a dedicated set of tables in the `sys_monitoring_*` namespace:

```sql
-- Core monitoring execution tracking
sys_monitoring_runs          -- Each scan/monitoring session
sys_monitoring_findings      -- Individual issues detected
sys_monitoring_metrics       -- Quantitative measurements over time
sys_monitoring_configs       -- Folder-specific monitoring rules
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Code monitoring (sys_*) vs Documentation monitoring (doc_*)
- **Granular Tracking**: Individual findings linked to specific files and lines
- **Historical Trends**: Metrics tracked over time for analysis
- **Configurable Rules**: Per-folder monitoring configurations

### **CLI Pipeline Location**

```
scripts/cli-pipeline/monitoring/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring-cli.sh          # Main CLI interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ folder-monitor.ts          # Core monitoring logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ health-check.sh           # Pipeline health validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json              # Dependencies
```

---

## üîç **Monitoring Categories**

### **1. Architecture Compliance**
- **Singleton Pattern Enforcement**: Detect direct `createClient()` usage
- **Import Pattern Validation**: Ensure proper shared service imports  
- **Service Extraction Opportunities**: Identify code that should be in `packages/shared/services/`

### **2. Code Quality Metrics**
- **File Size Analysis**: Flag files > 300 lines for potential splitting
- **Export Density**: Files with > 5 exports as shared service candidates  
- **Complexity Indicators**: Multiple responsibilities in single files

### **3. Standards Compliance**
- **CLAUDE.md Adherence**: Validate project conventions
- **Logging Standards**: Detect inappropriate `console.log` usage
- **TypeScript Best Practices**: Explicit typing, error handling

### **4. Technical Debt Detection**
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Security anti-patterns
- **Deprecated Patterns**: Old import styles, outdated libraries
- **Missing Tests**: Code without corresponding test coverage

---

## üìä **Current Implementation Status**

### ‚úÖ **Implemented Features**

1. **Basic Folder Scanning**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cli-pipeline/monitoring/monitoring-cli.sh scan apps/dhg-hub
   ```

2. **Database Schema**: Complete tables for tracking runs, findings, and metrics

3. **CLI Commands Available**:
   - `scan <folder>` - One-time analysis
   - `watch <folder>` - Continuous monitoring
   - `quick <folder>` - Last 24h changes only
   - `report <folder>` - Detailed analysis with DB persistence
   - `history <folder>` - Historical trend data
   - `trends <folder>` - Metric analysis over time

4. **Automated Detection**:
   - Large files (>300 lines)
   - Multiple exports (>5 per file)  
   - Direct Supabase client creation
   - Excessive console.log usage
   - New/modified files tracking

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Gaps & Next Steps**

1. **No Active Data Population**
   - Tables exist but appear to have no monitoring runs yet
   - Need to establish regular scanning schedules
   - Missing automated triggers for continuous monitoring

2. **Limited Rule Coverage**
   - Basic patterns implemented, need comprehensive CLAUDE.md rules
   - Missing architectural pattern detection
   - No shared service extraction suggestions

3. **No Alerting System**
   - Findings are detected but not actively reported
   - No integration with development workflow
   - Missing severity-based notifications

---

## üöÄ **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Activation** (Immediate)

1. **Populate Initial Data**
   ```bash
   # Run baseline scans for all major folders
   ./monitoring-cli.sh report apps/dhg-hub
   ./monitoring-cli.sh report packages/shared/services  
   ./monitoring-cli.sh report scripts/cli-pipeline
   ```

2. **Establish Regular Monitoring**
   - Set up scheduled scans (daily/weekly)
   - Configure folder-specific rules in `sys_monitoring_configs`
   - Define severity thresholds for different finding types

3. **Validate Current Pipeline**
   ```bash
   ./monitoring-cli.sh health-check
   ```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Detection** (Next Sprint)

1. **CLAUDE.md Rule Integration**
   - File placement validation (no files in root)
   - Import pattern compliance
   - Singleton service usage verification
   - TypeScript best practices enforcement

2. **Shared Service Detection**

   - Suggest common utilities for extraction
   - Flag non-singleton database clients

3. **Architecture Pattern Validation**
   - Enforce correct adapter patterns
   - Validate environment variable handling
   - Check for hardcoded credentials

### **Phase 3: Workflow Integration** (Future)

1. **Git Integration**
   - Pre-commit hooks for real-time validation
   - Pull request analysis and reporting
   - Automatic issue creation for critical findings

2. **Dashboard & Reporting**
   - Visual trend analysis
   - Code health scoring
   - Team/folder performance metrics

3. **Advanced Analytics**
