# AI Work Summary: Implement Merge Workflow Management System

**Date**: 2025-02-06
**Branch**: feature/continuous-documentation-archiving
**Commands Used**: work-summaries-cli.sh, todo-write
**Tags**: merge-workflow, branch-management, worktree-integration, task-tracking

## Summary

Started implementing comprehensive merge workflow recommendations for managing multiple feature branches in the monorepo. This includes creating database tracking for merge queue status, CLI commands for merge operations, automation scripts for the merge process, and UI components for visualization. The system will support sequential feature merging with pre-merge conflict detection, integration testing, and post-merge verification. Key features include branch status tracking, merge readiness indicators, and integration with the existing worktree workflow. This enhancement will streamline the process of merging improvements from multiple simultaneous branches back into the development branch.

## Tasks Created

1. Create merge queue tracking system in database (in progress)
2. Implement merge status CLI commands (pending)
3. Add merge workflow automation scripts (pending)
4. Create UI components for merge queue visualization (pending)
5. Implement conflict detection and pre-merge checks (pending)
6. Add post-merge verification and tracking (pending)

## Implementation Details

### Recommended Approach
- Sequential Feature Merging strategy
- Integration with existing worktree workflow
- Pre-merge conflict detection
- Post-merge verification tracking
- UI enhancements for merge queue visualization

### Next Steps
1. Create database schema for merge tracking
2. Implement CLI commands for merge operations
