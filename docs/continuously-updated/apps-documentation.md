## Technical Standards

### Shared Architecture
All applications follow these standards:

1. **Project Structure**:
   ```
   /app-name
     /src
       /components
       /hooks
       /services
       /utils
       App.tsx
       main.tsx
     index.html
     package.json
     vite.config.ts
   ```

2. **Shared Services**:
   - Use `packages/shared/services` for common functionality
   - Implement singleton pattern for service instances
   - Use dependency injection for testing

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Browser apps use `VITE_` prefixed variables
   - Store in `.env.development` and `.env.production`
   - Never commit secrets to repository

4. **TypeScript Standards**:
   - Strict mode enabled
   - Explicit typing for all functions
   - Use types from `supabase/types.ts`

5. **Component Guidelines**:
   - Functional components with hooks
   - Props interfaces for all components
   - Proper error boundaries

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Integration tests for API interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Deployment

### Build Process
All applications use Vite for building:
```bash
pnpm build --filter=app-name
```

### Deployment Targets
- **Production**: Netlify deployment
- **Staging**: Netlify preview deployments
- **Development**: Local development server

### Environment Management
- Separate `.env` files per environment
- Environment-specific build configurations
- Automated deployment via CI/CD

### Monitoring
- Error tracking with console logs
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics (privacy-compliant)
