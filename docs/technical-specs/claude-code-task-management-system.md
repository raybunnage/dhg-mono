# Claude Code Task Management System Design

## Overview

This document outlines a sophisticated task management system that integrates with Claude Code to provide end-to-end tracking of development requests, from initial submission through implementation and completion.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Task Submission Interface** (dhg-admin-code)
   - Dedicated page for enteri./scripts/cli-pipeline/work_summaries/work-summaries-cli.sh auto \
    "Clear title" \
    "Detailed description" \
    "command1,command2" \
    "tag1,tag2"ng development requests
   - Rich text editor for detailed task descriptions
   - Classification system for request types
   - Attachment support for screenshots, mockups, etc.

2. **Task Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Main task tracking table
   CREATE TABLE dev_tasks (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     description TEXT NOT NULL,
     task_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- bug, feature, documentation, design, question, refactor
     priority VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'medium', -- low, medium, high, critical
     status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, in_progress, review, completed, blocked
     branch_name VARCHAR(255),
     claude_session_id VARCHAR(255),
     submitted_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     assigned_to VARCHAR(255), -- Could be 'claude-code' or human developer
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     estimated_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
     actual_hours DECIMAL(5,2)
   );

   -- Task classification metadata
   CREATE TABLE dev_task_classifications (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     task_id UUID REFERENCES dev_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     category VARCHAR(100), -- frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, etc.
     tags TEXT[], -- Array of relevant tags
     affected_apps TEXT[], -- Which apps are affected
     complexity VARCHAR(20) -- simple, moderate, complex
   );

   -- Claude Code interaction tracking
   CREATE TABLE dev_task_claude_sessions (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     task_id UUID REFERENCES dev_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     session_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     session_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     request_file_path TEXT, -- Path to the request file Claude reads
     summary_file_path TEXT, -- Path to Claude's work summary
     tokens_used INTEGER,
     messages_exchanged INTEGER
   );

   -- Objects/files affected by tasks
   CREATE TABLE dev_task_artifacts (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     task_id UUID REFERENCES dev_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     artifact_type VARCHAR(50), -- file_created, file_modified, table_created, function_created
     artifact_path TEXT,
     artifact_name VARCHAR(255),
     action VARCHAR(50), -- created, modified, deleted
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Task dependencies
   CREATE TABLE dev_task_dependencies (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     task_id UUID REFERENCES dev_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     depends_on_task_id UUID REFERENCES dev_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     dependency_type VARCHAR(50) -- blocks, related_to, parent_of
   );
   ```

3. **Claude Code Integration Layer**
   - File-based communication system
   - Request serialization/deserialization
   - Work summary parser
   - Artifact tracker

4. **Task Dashboard** (dhg-admin-code)
   - Kanban-style board view
   - List view with filtering/sorting
   - Timeline/Gantt view for multi-task planning
   - Real-time status updates

## Workflow Design

### Task Submission Flow

1. **User Creates Task**
   - Navigate to dhg-admin-code task submission page
   - Fill out task details:
     - Title (concise summary)
     - Description (full details, acceptance criteria)
     - Type selection (bug, feature, etc.)
     - Priority setting
     - Category/tags
     - Affected apps
   - System auto-generates branch name: `task/{type}/{id}-{slugified-title}`
   - Submit creates database record

2. **Task Processing**
   - System creates Git branch automatically
   - Generates Claude Code request file at `.claude-tasks/pending/{task-id}.md`
   - File contains:
     ```markdown
     # Task: {title}
     ID: {task-id}
     Type: {type}
     Priority: {priority}
     Branch: {branch-name}
     
     ## Description
     {full description}
     
     ## Acceptance Criteria
     {criteria if provided}
     
     ## Context
     - Affected Apps: {apps}
     - Category: {category}
     - Tags: {tags}
     ```

3. **Claude Code Execution**
   - Claude Code monitors `.claude-tasks/pending/` directory
   - Reads task file and begins work
   - Updates status by writing to `.claude-tasks/status/{task-id}.json`
   - Creates work summary at `.claude-tasks/completed/{task-id}-summary.md`
   - Tracks all modified/created files

4. **Task Completion**
   - Claude Code moves task file to `.claude-tasks/completed/`
   - System parses summary and updates database
   - Notifications sent if configured
   - Task appears as completed in dashboard

## Multi-Branch Development Strategy

### Approach 1: Multiple Claude Code Instances
- Run separate Claude Code sessions in different terminal tabs
- Each session operates on its own branch
- Requires careful coordination to avoid conflicts

### Approach 2: Task Queue with Branch Switching
- Single Claude Code instance
- Queue-based processing with automatic branch switching
- Claude completes one task before moving to next
- More stable but sequential

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Primary Claude Code instance for main development
- Secondary instances for critical bugs or isolated features
- Task priority system determines processing order
- Branch management commands integrated into task system

### Branch Management Commands
```bash
# Built into task CLI
./scripts/cli-pipeline/tasks/task-cli.sh switch {task-id}
./scripts/cli-pipeline/tasks/task-cli.sh pause {task-id}
./scripts/cli-pipeline/tasks/task-cli.sh resume {task-id}
./scripts/cli-pipeline/tasks/task-cli.sh merge {task-id}
```

## Key Features

## Technical Considerations

### File System Structure
```
.claude-tasks/
├── pending/          # New tasks for Claude
├── in-progress/      # Currently being worked on
├── status/           # Status update files
├── completed/        # Finished tasks
└── summaries/        # Work summaries
```

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize all file paths
- Validate branch names
- Restrict file system access
- Audit trail for all actions

### Performance Optimization
- Index frequently queried fields
- Paginate large result sets
- Cache dashboard data
- Optimize file watchers

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if Claude unavailable
- Retry logic for file operations
- Transaction support for multi-step operations
- Comprehensive logging

## Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: Track all development work in one place
2. **Automated Workflow**: From request to implementation
3. **Historical Record**: Full audit trail of all changes
4. **Better Planning**: See workload and dependencies
5. **Quality Metrics**: Track completion times and complexity
6. **Knowledge Base**: Searchable history of all tasks

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI-Powered Features**
   - Auto-suggest similar completed tasks
   - Predict task complexity from description
   - Recommend optimal task ordering
   - Identify potential conflicts

2. **Collaboration Tools**
   - Task comments and discussions
   - Code review integration
   - Team assignment capabilities
   - Workload balancing

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Velocity tracking

   - Performance benchmarking

## Implementation Location

This system will be implemented as part of the **dhg-admin-code** application, which is specifically designed for code-focused administrative tasks. This makes it the ideal location for Claude Code integration and development task management, keeping it separate from the more general administrative functions in dhg-admin-suite.

## Conclusion

This system transforms ad-hoc Claude Code interactions into a structured, trackable development workflow. By combining task management, automated branch creation, and Claude Code integration, it provides complete visibility into the development process while maintaining the flexibility and power of AI-assisted coding.
