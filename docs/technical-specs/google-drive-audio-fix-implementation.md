# Google Drive Audio Loading Fix Implementation

## Issue
The dhg-audio app was failing to load audio files from Google Drive with the error:
> "Failed to load audio. Browser tracking prevention may be blocking access to Google Drive."

## Root Cause
Browser tracking prevention and Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions were blocking direct access to Google Drive `web_view_link` URLs in audio elements.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Google Drive URL Utilities (`apps/dhg-audio/src/utils/google-drive-utils.ts`)

Implemented utility functions based on CLAUDE.md guidance:

- **`extractDriveId()`** - Extracts Google Drive file ID from web_view_link
- **`getGoogleDriveDownloadUrl()`** - Creates direct download URL using `uc?export=download&id=`
- **`getGoogleDrivePreviewUrl()`** - Creates preview URL using `/preview` endpoint
- **`getAudioUrlOptions()`** - Returns array of URL options to try in order

### 2. Enhanced AudioPlayer Component

Updated `apps/dhg-audio/src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx`:

- **URL Fallback System**: Tries multiple Google Drive URL formats:
  1. Direct download URL (`drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=`)
  2. Preview URL (`drive.google.com/file/d/.../preview`)
  3. Original web_view_link as final fallback

- **Automatic Retry**: If one URL fails, automatically tries the next option
- **Improved Error Messages**: Shows how many URL formats were attempted
- **Better Recovery**: Retry button resets to first URL option

### 3. Enhanced TrackedAudioPlayer Component

Applied the same improvements to `apps/dhg-audio/src/components/TrackedAudioPlayer.tsx`:

- Same URL fallback system as AudioPlayer
- Maintains all media tracking functionality
- Consistent error handling and user experience

### 4. Implementation Details

**URL Priority Order**:
1. **Direct Download**: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id={driveId}`
   - Best for audio files - bypasses most browser restrictions
   - Works with `<audio>` elements directly
   
2. **Preview Endpoint**: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{driveId}/preview`
   - Recommended in CLAUDE.md for iframe embedding
   - Secondary option for audio
   
3. **Original web_view_link**: Final fallback to preserve existing functionality

**Error Handling**:
- Automatic progression through URL options
- User-friendly error messages explaining the issue
- Direct links to try opening files manually
- Retry functionality that resets the URL chain

## Benefits

1. **Better Compatibility**: Works across different browsers and security settings
2. **Automatic Fallback**: No user intervention needed for most cases
3. **Informative Errors**: Users understand why loading failed and have options
4. **Maintains Functionality**: All existing features (tracking, controls) preserved
5. **Follows Best Practices**: Implements CLAUDE.md guidance for Google Drive access

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Load an audio file in the dhg-audio app
2. Check browser console for URL attempt logging
3. If first URL fails, should automatically try the next option
4. Error message should show multiple URL attempts and provide manual links

## Future Considerations

- Monitor which URL format works best across different browsers
- Consider implementing server-side proxy for even better compatibility
- May need to handle rate limiting from Google Drive API
- Could cache successful URL patterns for better performance
