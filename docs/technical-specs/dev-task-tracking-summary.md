# Dev Task Tracking System - Executive Summary

## Overview

This specification defines a comprehensive tracking system that creates tight coupling between development tasks, Claude AI submissions, work summaries, validation processes, and follow-up subtasks. The system ensures no task falls through the cracks and provides clear visibility into what stage each task is in.

## Core Components

### 1. **Submission Tracking**
- Records when a task is submitted to Claude
- Tracks which worktree the work is being done in
- Links the submission to the dev task

### 2. **Work Summary Linkage**
- Automatically connects work summaries to their originating tasks
- Tracks files modified and commands used
- Provides traceability from task to implementation

### 3. **Validation Tracking**
- Records when follow-up validation is requested
- Links to clipboard snippets used for validation
- Tracks validation results and issues found

### 4. **Subtask Management**
- Creates subtasks from validation results
- Tracks dependencies between subtasks
- Monitors overall completion status

## Key Benefits

### For Task Management
- **Clear Status**: Always know if a task has been submitted, worked on, documented, and validated
- **No Lost Work**: Every piece of work is linked back to its originating task
- **True Completion**: Tasks aren't "done" until all validation and subtasks are complete

### For Workflow Efficiency
- **Next Action Always Clear**: System tells you exactly what needs to be done next
- **Bulk Operations**: Flag all tasks missing summaries or validation at once
- **Progress Tracking**: See completion percentage across all stages

### For Quality Assurance
- **Validation Required**: Tasks can't be fully closed without validation
- **Subtask Tracking**: Complex tasks broken down and tracked individually
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of submissions, work, and validation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Tracking (Immediate)
- Add tracking fields to existing tables
- Create submission and validation tables
- Implement basic CLI commands

### Phase 2: Automation (Week 1-2)
- Auto-link work summaries to tasks
- Create tracking dashboard
- Add UI indicators

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3+)
- Subtask dependency management
- Automated validation triggers
- Analytics and reporting

## Key Queries You'll Use Daily

### "What tasks need attention?"
```sql
SELECT title, 
  CASE
    WHEN NOT is_submitted THEN 'Need to submit'
    WHEN NOT has_summary THEN 'Need work summary'
    WHEN NOT is_validated THEN 'Need validation'
    ELSE 'Check subtasks'
  END as action_needed
FROM dev_task_tracking_view
WHERE completion_percentage < 100;
```

### "Show me my pipeline"
```
Not Submitted (3) → In Progress (5) → Need Summary (2) → Need Validation (4) → Done (15)
```

### "What's blocking completion?"
- 3 tasks never submitted to Claude
- 5 tasks worked on but no summary created
- 4 tasks completed but never validated
- 2 tasks with incomplete subtasks

## Success Metrics

1. **Submission Rate**: 100% of tasks have submission records
2. **Documentation Rate**: 100% of completed work has summaries
3. **Validation Rate**: 100% of summaries go through validation
4. **True Completion**: Clear distinction between "marked done" and "actually done"

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the specification
2. Create database migration for new fields/tables
3. Implement core CLI commands
4. Add UI components to dev tasks page
5. Begin tracking existing tasks

This system transforms dev task management from a simple todo list into a comprehensive workflow tracking system that ensures quality and completeness at every stage.
