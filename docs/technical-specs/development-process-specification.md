# Development Process Specification

This document outlines the comprehensive development process used in the DHG monorepo for designing, building, and iterating on features and components.

## 1. Tech Stack Overview

### Core Framework
- **React 18** with TypeScript for frontend components
- **Vite** for build tooling and development server
- **React Router (v6)** for navigation and routing

### State Management
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for component-level state
- React Context for shared application state
- Custom hooks for encapsulating reusable logic

### UI Framework
- **Tailwind CSS** with utility-first approach
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessible components
- **Shadcn UI** component library built on Radix
- Custom theme system with consistent styling

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase** for database, authentication, and storage
- Strongly-typed database interfaces
- Row-level security (RLS) policies
- Custom API routes for specialized functionality

### External Integrations
- **Google Drive API** for document synchronization and management
- **Claude API** (Anthropic) for AI-powered document analysis and content extraction
- **PDF.js** for PDF rendering and content extraction

### Testing & Quality
- **Vitest** for unit and component testing
- **Testing Library** for React component testing
- **ESLint** and **TypeScript** for static analysis
- **Prettier** for code formatting

## 2. Development Workflow

### Planning Phase
1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Document user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Create technical specifications with architecture diagrams
   - Define data models and API contracts

2. **Design System Integration**
   - Ensure new UI components follow design system guidelines
   - Use existing Shadcn/Radix components where possible
   - Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Development Phase
1. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   - Create feature branches from main branch
   - Use conventional commit messages
   - Include Claude AI attribution when AI-assisted

2. **Component Development**
   - Follow functional component pattern with hooks
   - Create strongly-typed props interfaces
   - Implement responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
   - Archive obsolete components with date suffix

3. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks for component state
   - Implement context providers for shared state
   - Minimize prop drilling through custom hooks

4. **Backend Integration**
   - Use typed Supabase clients
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Apply appropriate security policies (RLS)

### Testing Phase
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test individual components using Vitest
   - Mock external dependencies and API calls
   - Use Testing Library for component interaction testing

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test component compositions and interactions
   - Validate data flow between components
   - Test error handling and edge cases

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Verify implementation against acceptance criteria
   - Cross-browser testing for critical features
   - Accessibility testing using screen readers

### Deployment Phase
1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Run lint checks: `pnpm lint`
   - Run type checks: `tsc --noEmit`
   - Run test suite: `pnpm test:run`

2. **Build and Deploy**
   - Build application: `pnpm build`
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Perform verification testing in staging
   - Deploy to production environment

## 3. Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for functions and components
- README.md for each project with quick start
- Architectural decision records (ADRs) for significant decisions

### User Documentation
- Feature documentation with usage examples
- API documentation for backend services
- Integration guides for external systems

### Documentation Organization
- Follow the monorepo documentation structure
- Use frontmatter metadata for all documents
- Cross-reference instead of duplicating information
- Store prompts separately for AI-powered features

## 4. AI Integration Workflow

### Prompt Engineering
1. **Prompt Development**
   - Create and iterate prompts in development environment
   - Test with sample inputs for accuracy and consistency
   - Store finalized prompts in version control

2. **Prompt Management**
   - Maintain prompts in appropriate directory structure
   - Use structured templates with clear input/output definitions
   - Include examples and edge case handling

### AI Service Implementation
1. **API Integration**
   - Implement typed interfaces for API requests/responses
   - Handle rate limiting and retries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Content Processing Pipeline**
   - Extract content from documents (PDF, text, audio)
   - Pre-process content for AI consumption
   - Post-process AI outputs for application use

3. **Testing AI Functionality**
   - Test with representative inputs
   - Verify output formats and validation
   - Create regression tests for critical functionality

## 5. Google Drive Integration

### Authentication Flow
- OAuth2 authentication with appropriate scopes
- Token storage and refresh mechanisms
- Error handling for authentication failures

### Synchronization Process
1. **File Discovery**
   - Query Drive API for files matching criteria
   - Track file metadata and changes
   - Handle pagination and rate limits

2. **Content Synchronization**
   - Download file content when needed
   - Track sync status and history
   - Handle conflicts and errors

3. **Metadata Management**
   - Track file relationships and hierarchies
   - Store and update metadata in Supabase
   - Optimize for performance with selective sync

## 6. Iteration and Improvement

### Performance Optimization
- Component memoization where appropriate
- Lazy-loading for route-based code splitting
- Optimized asset delivery and caching

### Feedback Collection
- User feedback mechanisms within the application
- Error tracking and reporting
- Usage analytics for feature adoption

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular code refactoring sessions
- Technical debt management
- Architecture reviews and updates

## 7. Tools and Commands

- Shared configuration for linting, testing, and TypeScript
- Project-specific overrides when necessary

## 9. Code Style and Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- **Directories**: kebab-case (e.g., `document-types/`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

### File Organization
- Group related components in feature directories
- Co-locate tests with implementation files
- Use index files for cleaner imports
- Archive obsolete files with date suffix

### Coding Standards
- Functional components with hooks
- Explicit type definitions
- Avoid prop drilling with context or custom hooks
- Comments for complex logic

## 10. Quality Assurance
