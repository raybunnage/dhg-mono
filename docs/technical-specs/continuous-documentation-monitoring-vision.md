# Continuous Documentation Monitoring: Vision & Implementation Plan

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: Active Planning  
**Review Cycle**: Weekly

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive system for managing the proliferation of documentation in the DHG monorepo (currently ~450+ markdown files) through a continuous monitoring approach. The system will maintain a small set of "living documents" as single sources of truth while intelligently archiving historical documentation for reference.

## Vision

### Core Principles

1. **Living Documentation Over Static Files**
   - Maintain 10-15 core documents that are continuously updated
   - Archive everything else with intelligent retrieval capabilities
   - Each living document owns a specific domain of knowledge

2. **Automated Review Cycles**
   - Regular prompts to review and update living documents
   - Stale content detection and alerts
   - Automatic extraction of relevant information from new documentation

3. **Intelligent Archiving**
   - Preserve historical context while removing clutter
   - Full-text search across archived content
   - Relationship tracking between archived and living documents

4. **Single Source of Truth**
   - One authoritative document per major domain
   - Clear ownership and responsibility model
   - Version tracking with rollback capabilities

### Success Metrics

- Reduce active documentation from 450+ files to <20 living documents
- 90%+ of documentation queries answerable from living documents
- <5 minute average time to find any piece of information
- Zero duplicated or conflicting documentation

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists
- **Database Infrastructure**: Tables created (`doc_continuous_monitoring`, `doc_archives`, `doc_monitoring_history`)
- **Initial Living Documents**: 8 files in `continuously-updated/` folder
- **CLI Pipeline Structure**: Ready for documentation management commands
- **Code Monitoring System**: Parallel system that can be adapted

### What's Missing
- Population of database with existing documentation
- Automated review cycle implementation
- Archive extraction and relationship mapping
- CLI commands for managing the system
- Integration with AI for content extraction

## Priority Areas

### Phase 1: Core Living Documents (Week 1)

These documents will serve as the primary knowledge bases:

1. **`cli-pipeline-operations.md`**
   - Consolidates all CLI pipeline documentation
   - Merges content from 55+ files in cli-pipeline/
   - Sections: Available commands, pipeline architecture, troubleshooting

2. **`monorepo-architecture.md`**
   - Overall system design and structure
   - App relationships and dependencies
   - Development workflow and standards

3. **`database-schema-guide.md`**
   - Current schema documentation
   - Table relationships and naming conventions
   - Migration procedures

4. **`shared-services-catalog.md`**
   - Available shared services and their APIs
   - Usage patterns and examples
   - Service dependencies

5. **`deployment-operations.md`**
   - Environment setup and configuration
   - Deployment procedures
   - Infrastructure management

### Phase 2: Archive System (Week 2)

1. **Scan and Catalog**
   - Index all existing documentation
   - Extract metadata and key concepts
   - Map relationships between documents

2. **Intelligent Archiving**
   - Move documents to `.archive_docs/` folders
   - Maintain searchable index in database
   - Track which living document owns each archive

3. **Extraction Pipeline**
   - AI-powered content extraction
   - Identify unique information not in living docs
   - Queue for manual review and integration

### Phase 3: Automation (Week 3)

1. **Review Cycle Implementation**
   - Weekly automated reviews for high-priority docs
   - Monthly reviews for stable documentation
   - Stale content warnings

2. **Change Detection**
   - Monitor code changes that might need doc updates
   - Track which docs reference changed code
   - Generate update suggestions

3. **Search and Retrieval**
   - Full-text search across living and archived docs
   - Contextual recommendations
   - "Did you mean?" functionality

## Practical Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation

**Day 1-2: Database Population**
```bash
# Create CLI command to scan documentation
./scripts/cli-pipeline/documentation/doc-monitor-cli.sh scan

# Populate initial living documents
./scripts/cli-pipeline/documentation/doc-monitor-cli.sh register \
  --file docs/continuously-updated/cli-pipelines-documentation.md \
  --priority high \
  --review-cycle weekly
```

**Day 3-4: Content Consolidation**
- Manual review of top 5 living documents
- Extract unique content from related files
- Update living documents with consolidated information

**Day 5: CLI Pipeline Development**
- Implement core commands: scan, register, review, archive
- Add search functionality
- Create reporting commands

### Week 2: Archive Implementation

**Day 1-2: Archive Structure**
```
docs/
  continuously-updated/     # Living documents
  .archive_docs/           # Archived documents
    2025-06-08/           # Date-based organization
      cli-pipeline/       # Maintains original structure
      technical-specs/
```

**Day 3-4: Relationship Mapping**
- Build graph of document relationships
- Identify content ownership
- Create archive manifest

**Day 5: Migration Execution**
- Move documents to archive
- Update database with locations
- Verify search functionality

### Week 3: Automation & Polish

**Day 1-2: Review Automation**
- Implement review reminder system
- Create review UI/CLI interface
- Add metrics tracking

**Day 3-4: AI Integration**
- Content extraction pipeline
- Duplicate detection
- Update suggestion generation

**Day 5: Testing & Documentation**
- End-to-end testing
- User documentation
- Training materials

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (Already Implemented)
```sql
-- Core tables created in migration 20250608_create_documentation_monitoring_tables.sql
- doc_continuous_monitoring (living documents)
- doc_archives (archived documents)
- doc_monitoring_history (audit trail)
```

### CLI Pipeline Structure
```
scripts/cli-pipeline/documentation/
  doc-monitor-cli.sh           # Main CLI interface
  commands/
    scan-documentation.ts      # Scan and index docs
    register-document.ts       # Register living document
    review-document.ts         # Review interface
    archive-documents.ts       # Bulk archive operation
    search-documentation.ts    # Search all docs
    extract-content.ts         # AI content extraction
```

### Integration Points
- Hooks into git commits for change detection
- Integration with AI services for content analysis
- Scheduled jobs for review reminders
- API endpoints for UI access

## Lessons Learned (To Be Updated)

### What Works
- Database-driven approach provides flexibility
- Living documents reduce confusion
- Automated reviews ensure freshness

### What Doesn't Work
- Manual consolidation is time-consuming
- Over-categorization creates more problems
- Rigid structures don't adapt to changing needs

### Best Practices
1. Start small with core documents
2. Archive aggressively but searchably
3. Automate everything possible
4. Regular reviews are critical
5. Clear ownership prevents drift

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Review and approve this plan
2. **Week 1 Start**: Begin database population and CLI development
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Get feedback on priority documents
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assign team members to implementation

This plan provides a clear path from the current state of ~450 scattered documents to a manageable set of living documents with intelligent archiving. The key is to start small, automate aggressively, and maintain discipline around the living document approach.
