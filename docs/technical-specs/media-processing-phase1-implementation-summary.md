# Media Processing Pipeline - Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the unified media processing pipeline, consolidating redundant commands and establishing a foundation for efficient media processing.

## Completed Items

### 1. Unified Command Structure ✅
Created new unified commands that replace multiple redundant commands:

- **`process`** - Main entry point that automatically detects what needs to be done
- **`find-media`** - Replaces find-missing-media, find-processable-videos, find-untranscribed-media
- **`convert`** - Unified MP4 to M4A conversion
- **`transcribe`** - Unified transcription command with batch support
- **`upload-m4a`** - New command to upload M4A files to Google Drive

### 2. Configuration Management ✅
Implemented YAML-based configuration at `config/media-processing.yaml`:

```yaml
sources:
  google_drive:
    root: "/path/to/google/drive"
    folders: ["folder1", "folder2"]
    
processing:
  temp_dir: "./file_types"
  max_parallel: 3
  default_model: "whisper-large-v3"
  default_accelerator: "A10G"
  
storage:
  auto_cleanup: true
  max_cache_size: "50GB"
  retention_days: 7
```

### 3. Unified Status Tracking ✅
Created `media_processing_status` table with comprehensive tracking:

- Single source of truth for all media processing operations
- Tracks complete lifecycle: pending → downloading → converting → transcribing → summarizing → uploading → completed
- Includes error tracking and retry counts
- Stores M4A upload information

### 4. M4A Upload Service ✅
Implemented `M4AUploadService` in shared services:

- Uploads M4A files to Google Drive alongside MP4 sources
- Creates proper database entries
- Links M4A files to expert documents
- Supports batch uploads

### 5. Updated CLI Integration ✅
- Updated `media-processing-cli.sh` with new commands
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy commands
- Added proper help documentation
- Registered all commands in the command registry

## Usage Examples

### Find Media Files
```bash
# Find files needing processing
./scripts/cli-pipeline/media-processing/media-processing-cli.sh find-media --limit 10

# Output format options
find-media --format commands  # Get process commands
find-media --format json      # JSON output
find-media --all              # Show all files
```

### Process Files
```bash
# Automatically process files (full pipeline)
./scripts/cli-pipeline/media-processing/media-processing-cli.sh process --limit 5

# Run specific stage
process --stage convert       # Only convert
process --stage transcribe    # Only transcribe
process --stage upload        # Only upload M4A
```

### Upload M4A Files
```bash
# Upload specific document's M4A
upload-m4a --document-id <doc-id>

# Batch upload all ready M4A files
upload-m4a --batch --limit 20

# Dry run to see what would be uploaded
upload-m4a --batch --dry-run
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Command Structure**: Reduced from 20+ overlapping commands to 5 core commands
2. **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings in one YAML file
3. **Unified Tracking**: Single database table tracks entire processing lifecycle
4. **M4A Upload Capability**: Can now upload processed audio files back to Google Drive for streaming
5. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and retry logic

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Implement smart file management with local cache
2. Add Google Drive Desktop integration for efficient file access
3. Implement parallel processing optimization
4. Add progress tracking and ETA calculations

## Technical Notes

- All new commands use TypeScript with proper type safety
- Integrated with existing singleton services (Supabase, Claude)
- Database migration applied successfully
- Command registry updated with new commands
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows
