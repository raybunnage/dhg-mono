# Continuous Documentation Monitoring - Quick Start Guide

**Purpose**: Get the documentation monitoring system up and running quickly

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration
```bash
# Test the migration first
./scripts/cli-pipeline/database/database-cli.sh migration test supabase/migrations/20250608_create_documentation_monitoring_tables.sql

# Apply the migration
./scripts/cli-pipeline/database/database-cli.sh migration run-staged supabase/migrations/20250608_create_documentation_monitoring_tables.sql
```

### 2. Create Initial CLI Pipeline Structure
```bash
# Create the docs pipeline directory
mkdir -p scripts/cli-pipeline/docs

# The pipeline will include these initial commands:
# - register: Register a new living document
# - list: List all monitored documents  
# - check-reviews: Show documents needing review
# - archive: Archive old documentation
# - search: Search archived documents
```

### 3. Identify Your First Living Documents

Start with these high-impact areas:

1. **CLI Pipelines Documentation** 
   - Consolidate info from 100+ pipeline docs
   - Single source for all CLI commands
   
2. **Apps Overview**
   - Current state of each app
   - Dependencies and relationships
   
3. **Database Architecture**
   - Table naming conventions
   - Migration procedures
   
4. **Deployment Guide**
   - Environment setup
   - Server configurations

### 4. First Week Action Plan

**Day 1-2: Setup**
- Run migration
- Create basic CLI structure
- Register first 5 living documents

**Day 3-4: Content Migration**
- Consolidate existing docs into living documents
- Archive the originals with relationships

**Day 5-7: Workflow Integration**
- Set up review reminders
- Test search functionality
- Create first status report

## Example: Registering Your First Living Document

```bash
# Once CLI is set up, register the CLI pipelines doc
./scripts/cli-pipeline/docs/docs-cli.sh register \
  --path "docs/continuously-updated/cli-pipelines-documentation.md" \
  --area "cli-pipeline" \
  --title "CLI Pipeline Architecture" \
  --frequency 14 \
  --priority high

# Check what needs review
./scripts/cli-pipeline/docs/docs-cli.sh check-reviews

# Archive related old docs
./scripts/cli-pipeline/docs/docs-cli.sh archive \
  --pattern "docs/cli-pipeline/*.md" \
  --relate-to [living-doc-id] \
  --reason "Consolidated into living documentation"
```

## Quick Win: Archive Old Documentation

Before full implementation, you can start archiving:

1. Create archive directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/.archived_docs/{2024,2025}/{cli-pipeline,deployment,database}
```

2. Move obviously outdated docs:
```bash
# Example: Archive old TODO files
mv docs/*TODO*.md docs/.archived_docs/2024/
mv docs/*OLD*.md docs/.archived_docs/2024/
mv docs/*deprecated*.md docs/.archived_docs/2024/
```

3. Document what you archived:
```bash
# Create archive index
echo "# Archived Documentation Index" > docs/.archived_docs/INDEX.md
echo "## 2024 Archives" >> docs/.archived_docs/INDEX.md
ls docs/.archived_docs/2024/ >> docs/.archived_docs/INDEX.md
```

## Measuring Success

After one week, you should have:
- ✅ 5-10 living documents registered
- ✅ 50+ old documents archived
- ✅ Working CLI for basic operations
- ✅ Clear improvement in finding current information

## Remember

- Start small - don't try to process all 700 docs at once
- Focus on high-value documentation first
- Archive aggressively - you can always retrieve if needed
- Update living docs as you work, not in batch sessions
