# Service Dependency System - Implementation Status

## âœ… COMPLETED

### Database Migration
- **Migration Applied**: All 9 tables have been created successfully
- **Tables Created**:
  - `services_registry` - Catalog of shared services
  - `apps_registry` - Registry of applications
  - `cli_pipelines_registry` - CLI pipeline tracking
  - `cli_commands_registry` - Individual command tracking
  - `app_service_dependencies` - App-to-service mappings
  - `pipeline_service_dependencies` - Pipeline-to-service mappings
  - `command_service_dependencies` - Command-to-service mappings
  - `service_exports` - Service export tracking
  - `dependency_analysis_runs` - Analysis audit log

### CLI Pipeline Implementation
- **âœ… Pipeline Created**: `scripts/cli-pipeline/service_dependencies/`
- **âœ… Package.json Updated**: Added `service-deps` shortcut
- **âœ… TypeScript Issues Fixed**: Resolved ESM/CommonJS compatibility

### Working Commands
- **âœ… `init-system`** - Verifies setup and provides guidance
- **âœ… `scan-services`** - Discovers and analyzes shared services
- **âœ… `scan-apps`** - Discovers and analyzes applications
- **âœ… `health-check`** - Verifies system health

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Database CLI Usage**: Used proper `migration validate/test/run-staged` workflow
2. **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed tsconfig.node.json usage across all commands
3. **Glob Import**: Fixed to use promisified version for async/await
4. **Variable Scoping**: Fixed analysisRunId scope in init-system
5. **Package.json Type**: Removed `"type": "module"` to fix compatibility

## ðŸš€ READY TO USE

The system is now fully operational. You can:

### 1. Populate the Service Registry
```bash
# Scan all shared services (84 services found)
pnpm service-deps scan-services

# Or preview first
pnpm service-deps scan-services --dry-run --verbose
```

### 2. Populate the Apps Registry
```bash
# Scan all applications (10 apps found)
pnpm service-deps scan-apps

# Or preview first
pnpm service-deps scan-apps --dry-run --verbose
```

### 3. View System Status
```bash
# Check system health
pnpm service-deps health-check

# Initialize system (shows plan)
pnpm service-deps init-system --verbose
```

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS

Once you've populated the basic registries, the next commands to implement are:

1. **`scan-pipelines`** - Register all 33 CLI pipelines
2. **`scan-commands`** - Register individual commands within pipelines
3. **`analyze-dependencies`** - Parse TypeScript imports to map relationships
4. **`export-report`** - Generate comprehensive dependency reports

## ðŸŽ¯ VALUE DELIVERED

With just the current implementation, you can already:

- **See all shared services** with their types (singleton, adapter, utility)
- **View all applications** with frameworks and configurations
- **Understand service architecture** through categorization
- **Track service evolution** with the registry system

The foundation is solid and ready for incremental enhancement as needed.
