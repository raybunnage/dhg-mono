# Tag Filtering System

This feature allows users to filter documentation files by tags. The tags are displayed as pills that can be clicked to toggle filtering by that tag.

## Features

- Displays the most frequent tags from the documentation files
- Shows tag count for each tag pill
- Supports multi-tag filtering (documents must contain ALL selected tags)
- Properly handles both AI-generated and manual tags
- Visual indication of which tags are currently selected

## Client-Side Tag Extraction

The tag system now uses client-side tag extraction, which provides several advantages:

1. **No database function required** - The system works without any special database setup
2. **Handles multiple tag formats** - Works with array fields, JSON strings, or comma-separated strings
3. **Case-insensitive** - Tags are normalized for consistent matching
4. **Robust error handling** - Gracefully handles malformed tags data

### How It Works

The tag extraction process:

1. Collects all tags from both ai_generated_tags and manual_tags fields
2. Normalizes tags (trims whitespace, converts to lowercase)
3. Counts occurrences of each tag
4. Displays the most common tags as clickable pills
5. When tags are selected, filters documents to only show those with ALL selected tags

### Improvements

The updated implementation includes:

- Better error handling for various tag data formats
- Consistent visual display of tags with counts
- Improved tag filtering logic for more accurate results
- Capitalization of display tags for readability
- Hover tooltips showing tag details

## How Tag Filtering Works

When tags are selected:

1. The system queries the database for documents containing those tags
2. Additional client-side filtering ensures that documents contain ALL selected tags
3. The document list is updated to show only matching documents
4. Document types with no matching documents are hidden

To clear filters, click the "Clear Filters" button at the top of the tags section.
