# Analysis of documentation_files Table

Without specific details about your current documentation_files table structure, I'll provide a general analysis of common issues and best practices for documentation management in a monorepo.

## Common Issues with Documentation Files in Databases
- Inconsistent metadata tracking (creation dates, authors, versions)
- Poor organization leading to duplicate or outdated files
- Lack of clear relationships between code and corresponding documentation
- Insufficient versioning to match documentation with code releases

## Best Practices for Documentation in a Monorepo

### 1. Implement a Consistent Directory Structure
**Recommendation:** Create a standardized documentation hierarchy that mirrors your code structure.
- Place documentation close to the code it describes (e.g., `/src/module/docs/`)
- Maintain a central index in a `/docs` directory with cross-references
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `component-name.md`, `api-reference.md`)

### 2. Establish Documentation Versioning Strategy
**Recommendation:** Align documentation versions with code releases.
- Tag documentation with the same version numbers as code releases
- Implement a documentation changelog to track significant updates
- Consider using a documentation versioning tool like Docusaurus or MkDocs
- Store version metadata in your documentation_files table to enable filtering
