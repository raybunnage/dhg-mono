### ðŸ“‹ MEDIUM Complexity (8)
Not started yet - will tackle after LOW complexity

### ðŸ“‹ HIGH Complexity (3)
Not started yet - will tackle last

## Key Learnings
1. Simplified base pattern works better than complex inheritance
2. Enhanced logging and validation improves usability
3. Maintaining 100% API compatibility is achievable
4. Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

## Next Steps
- Continue with docs-cli.sh refactoring
- Apply same simplified pattern
- Focus on maintainability and clarity
