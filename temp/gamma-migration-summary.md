## Key Improvements

### Standardization
- All pipelines now use consistent base classes
- Unified command tracking across all pipelines
- Standardized help formatting and error handling

### Service Integration
- ServiceCLIPipeline provides health checks and service management
- Fallback patterns for missing services
- Service discovery warnings but graceful degradation

### Enhanced Features
- ProcessingCLIPipeline adds batch processing for email-cli.sh
- ManagementCLIPipeline adds workflow validation for git-workflow-cli.sh
- Improved command routing with hyphenated command support

### Technical Issues Resolved
- Fixed duplicate case statements in original scripts
- Proper path resolution for base classes
- Consistent error handling and logging

## Migration Statistics
- Total pipelines: 16
- Successfully migrated: 16 (100%)
- Base class distribution:
  - SimpleCLIPipeline: 3
  - ServiceCLIPipeline: 7
  - ProcessingCLIPipeline: 1
  - ManagementCLIPipeline: 1
  - Already migrated: 2
  - Archived/validated: 2

## Next Steps
1. Monitor service integration warnings
2. Create service registry entries for missing services
3. Test all migrated pipelines with real workflows
4. Update documentation for new standardized commands

## Checkpoint Files Created
All original scripts backed up to `temp/archived-code/` with timestamps.
