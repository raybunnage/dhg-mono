# Beta Group Quick Reference

## 🎯 Current Focus
Refactoring content & data processing pipelines to use standardized base classes.

## 🔧 Available Base Classes
- **SimpleCLIPipeline** - Basic CLI operations (start here!)
- **ProcessingCLIPipeline** - Data transformation pipelines
- **ServiceCLIPipeline** - Service-oriented pipelines
- **ManagementCLIPipeline** - Resource management pipelines

## 🔒 3-Stage Checkpoint System
1. **baseline** - Original code backed up
2. **migrated** - Base class integration complete
3. **validated** - Tests pass, ready for production

## 📊 Progress Tracking Commands
```bash
# Source the framework
source scripts/cli-pipeline/base-classes/multi-worktree-framework.sh

# Register Beta worktree
register_worktree_group "beta" "$(pwd)" "17-pipelines"

# Create checkpoint
checkpoint "baseline" "mime-types-cli.sh" "beta"

# Update progress
update_pipeline_progress "beta" "mime-types-cli.sh" "migrated" "ProcessingCLIPipeline base"

# Check conflicts with other groups
check_pipeline_conflicts "mime-types-cli.sh" "beta"

# Submit issues
submit_glitch "mime-types-cli.sh" "beta" "integration" "Import path issues" "medium"
```

## 🚀 Migration Workflow
1. Pick a low-complexity pipeline
2. Create baseline checkpoint
3. Analyze current implementation
4. Choose appropriate base class
5. Migrate to base class pattern
6. Create migrated checkpoint
7. Add/update tests
8. Validate functionality
9. Create validated checkpoint
10. Update documentation

## ⚠️ Beta-Specific Considerations
- Many pipelines interact with Google APIs
- Document processing often involves AI services
- Media pipelines may have long-running operations
- Ensure backward compatibility for data formats
