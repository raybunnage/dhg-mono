- ✅ Database connectivity verified
- ✅ All command patterns follow base class standards

## Usage Statistics Integration
The pipeline includes usage statistics showing:
- **Most Used**: table-records (13 uses), empty-tables (5 uses)
- **Moderate Use**: connection-test, db-health-check (4 uses each)
- **Developing Use**: database-functions, table-structure (3 uses each)

## Migration Impact
- **Backwards Compatibility**: 100% maintained
