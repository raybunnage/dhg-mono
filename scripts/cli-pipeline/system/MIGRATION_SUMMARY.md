# System CLI Pipeline - Migration Summary

## Overview
**Pipeline**: system-cli.sh  
**Complexity**: LOW  
**Base Class**: SimpleCLIPipeline (Note: ServiceCLIPipeline may be more appropriate)  
**Migration Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  

## Changes Made

### 1. Base Class Integration
- Migrated from custom implementation to SimpleCLIPipeline base class
- Fixed missing track-command.sh dependency issue
- Leverages standard logging, error handling, and command routing

### 2. Improved Structure
- Commands now follow standard `command_<name>` pattern
- Added fallback implementations for missing TypeScript files
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Added new commands discovered in directory:
  - `apply-registry-migration` - Apply service registry database migration
  - `show-migrated` - Display migrated scripts
- Enhanced health check with comprehensive system validation
- Database connectivity testing for registry operations

### 4. Service Integration
- Documents missing services for future implementation
- Provides fallback database queries where appropriate

## Service Dependencies

### Available Services
- None currently (direct TypeScript execution)

### Missing Services (Documented)
- **SystemService** - Would provide:
  - System information retrieval
  - Process management
  - Resource monitoring
  - OS-level operations
  
- **HealthCheckService** - Would provide:
  - Standardized health check framework
  - Service status monitoring
  - Dependency health validation
  - Aggregate health reporting

## Command Mapping

| Old Command | New Command | Status | Notes |
|------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| populate-services | populate-services | âœ… | Core functionality |
| show-services | show-services | âœ… | Database fallback added |
| show-apps | show-apps | âœ… | Directory scan fallback |
| show-pipelines | show-pipelines | âœ… | Database query fallback |
| analyze-dependencies | analyze-dependencies | âœ… | Dependency mapping |
| N/A | apply-registry-migration | ðŸ†• | New command added |
| N/A | show-migrated | ðŸ†• | New command added |
| health-check | health-check | âœ… | Enhanced version |

## Breaking Changes
- None - All commands maintain same interface
- track-command.sh dependency removed (now handled by base class)

## Implementation Notes

### Future Considerations
- **ServiceCLIPipeline Migration**: This pipeline manages service registries and would benefit from ServiceCLIPipeline base class features:
  - Built-in service discovery
  - Service health monitoring
  - Start/stop/restart capabilities
  - Process management utilities

### Database Connectivity
- The pipeline requires database access for most operations
- Fallback queries implemented where possible
- Health check validates database connectivity

### Missing TypeScript Files
Several referenced TypeScript files don't exist:
- show-services.ts (fallback to DB query)
- show-applications.ts (fallback to directory scan)
- show-pipelines.ts (fallback to DB query)
- health-check.ts (fallback implementation)

## Benefits
1. **Consistency** - Uses standard base class patterns
2. **Reliability** - Fallback implementations prevent failures
3. **Maintainability** - Cleaner code structure
4. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new system commands
5. **Observability** - Integrated logging and tracking

## Next Steps
1. Implement SystemService for OS-level operations
2. Implement HealthCheckService for standardized health checks
3. Create missing TypeScript command files
4. Consider migration to ServiceCLIPipeline base class
5. Add more system monitoring commands

## Files Changed
- `system-cli.sh` - Refactored to use SimpleCLIPipeline
- `.archived_scripts/system-cli.20250614.sh` - Original archived

## Testing
```bash
# Test basic functionality
./system-cli.sh help
./system-cli.sh health-check

# Test core commands
./system-cli.sh populate-services
./system-cli.sh show-services
./system-cli.sh show-apps
./system-cli.sh analyze-dependencies

# Test new commands
./system-cli.sh show-migrated
./system-cli.sh apply-registry-migration

# Test with debug mode
DEBUG=1 ./system-cli.sh show-pipelines
