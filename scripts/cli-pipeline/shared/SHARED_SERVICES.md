## Implementation Priorities

For immediate implementation, we recommend focusing on:

1. **Environment Service**: Crucial for consistent configuration across pipelines
2. **Logger Service**: Essential for debugging and monitoring
3. **Database Service**: Central to most operations
4. **CLI Interface Service**: Improves user experience substantially

## Architecture Guidelines

When implementing these shared services:

1. Use dependency injection for better testability
2. Maintain singleton instances where appropriate
3. Design clear interfaces with comprehensive documentation
4. Add extensive unit tests for each service
5. Include error handling at every level
