# Continuous CLI Pipeline Migration Summary

## Migration Date: 2025-01-14

## Changes Made

### 1. Base Class Migration
- Migrated from custom implementation to `SimpleCLIPipeline`
- Standardized command structure and help display
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Command Standardization
- Changed command pattern to use `command_` prefix:
  - `run_tests` → `command_test`
  - `discover_inventory` → `command_discover`
  - `check_standards` → `command_check`
  - `generate_report` → `command_report`
  - `show_trends` → `command_trends`
  - `run_daily` → `command_daily`
- Added explicit `command_help` function

### 3. Location
- Script remains in `/scripts/cli-pipeline/continuous/` subdirectory
- Supporting files (simple-test-runner.ts) remain in same location

### 4. Service Dependencies
- No new service dependencies identified
- Uses discover-new-services.ts from shared-services pipeline
- Implements fallback counting when TypeScript files unavailable

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
- All original functionality preserved
- Commands work identically to original implementation
- Same philosophy and phase 1 focus maintained

## Testing Results
- ✅ Help command tested successfully
- ✅ Report command works correctly
- ✅ Fallback implementations included
- ✅ Inventory counting accurate

## Notes
- This is a "Phase 1" pipeline focused on simple measurement
- Several features marked as "not yet implemented" - preserved as-is
- Future enhancement: Create ContinuousMonitoringService for centralized functionality
- Good example of a pipeline that calls other pipelines' functionality
