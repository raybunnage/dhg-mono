# Proxy CLI Pipeline Migration Summary

## Migration Date: 2025-01-14

## Changes Made

### 1. Base Class Migration
- Migrated from custom implementation to `SimpleCLIPipeline`
- Standardized command structure and help display
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Command Standardization
- Changed command pattern to use `command_` prefix:
  - Added `command_help`
  - `start-all` → `command_start-all`
  - `start` → `command_start`
  - `update-registry` → `command_update-registry`
  - `list` → `command_list`
  - `health-check` → `command_health-check`

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Challenge**: Bash associative arrays not supported in older bash versions
- **Solution**: Replaced associative array with function-based configuration
- Created `get_proxy_config()` function for proxy configuration lookup
- Created `get_all_proxy_names()` function for iteration

### 4. Service Dependencies
- Documented potential need for `ProxyServerService` in cli-service-integration-issues.md
- Uses individual TypeScript start scripts for each proxy
- Implements fallback display when scripts not available

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
- All original functionality preserved
- Commands work identically to original implementation
- Same proxy server configurations maintained
- Health check functionality retained

## Testing Results
- ✅ Help command tested successfully
- ✅ List command works correctly
- ✅ Configuration lookup functions work properly
- ✅ Bash compatibility issue resolved

## Notes
- This pipeline manages 12 different proxy servers
- Each proxy has its own TypeScript start script
- Future enhancement: Create ProxyServerService for centralized proxy management
- Good example of converting associative arrays to functions for compatibility
