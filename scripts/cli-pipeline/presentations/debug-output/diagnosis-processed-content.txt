This is a shell command to update a prompt service with a new prompt definition, followed by the prompt content itself. The command is:

```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt_service/prompt-service-cli.sh update --prompt-name "final_video-summary-prompt" --file-path "prompts/final_video-summary-prompt.md"
```

The prompt being updated is called "final_video-summary-prompt" and it defines an AI task for generating summaries of expert video presentations based on transcripts.

The prompt instructs the AI to:
1. Create a structured JSON summary of an expert presentation video
2. Extract key information about the speaker, presentation content, and discussion
3. Format the output in a specific JSON structure with fields for speaker profile, presentation essence, key takeaways, memorable quotes, discussion highlights, and more
4. Create an engaging 200-300 word narrative summary that captures the presentation's value

The prompt includes detailed style guidelines for creating summaries that are enthusiastic, specific, and convey the unique value of the presentation while maintaining accurate JSON formatting.

This appears to be part of a system for processing video content and generating structured, informative summaries to help users decide which videos to watch from a collection.
