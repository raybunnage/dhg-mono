We're going to start a little bit of a different format this time. And we think that in general what's been happening on Fridays are small group meets the sort of the steering group of the polyvagal thing in the dynamic hearing process. And we just give the most interesting discussions. And we realize that that's why we started the group in the first place. It wasn't just to give lectures and just teach people ideas actually deepen our knowledge. And so what the biggest part of the group has been is just simply connecting silos. So we may or may not reach a lot of people in numbers, but what we're doing, we're actually get these really deep silos connecting, for instance, with the roots why Giverts, how you pronounce your last names of Giverts. We're just stunned to see he really did almost a, I think a Nobel Prize level work on muscle spindles from myology that is blooming away. And it has it really surface. Then Dr. Lane last week presented this data that the brain is a choice between emotional pain and physical pain. It chooses physical pain. It's a way you can see it externalize it. And humans don't tolerate emotional pain very well. So the data is, you know, I've just seen the data better, but just the concept makes sense. And we all know about cutting, but didn't realize with cutting, you actually get a significant relief, but you're leaving the emotional pain. It is somehow externalizing and conceiving. So it's not just a distraction, it's not just self-destruction. You actually get relief by creating physical pain instead of emotional pain. So this process is called, I want to talk about rats repetitive and pleasant thoughts. And I'll start with a story that about 15 years ago, I was in clinic and I have an intake spine questionnaire that people on a zero-tenscale about anxiety, depression and irritability. And four people came in between 45 to 60. They were highly professional. One was a real estate developer, very wealthy. Another one was a swatting guy. And really, you know, really solid people. And they had surgical lesions. They had alphyrdeicopathy. They had spinal ethyases. They were actually up for surgery. And I looked at the questionnaire and all of them had a 10 out of 10 on anxiety, depression and irritability. We're going, huh. So I asked them a simple question. They look, I have a choice to actually do in surgery on you and get rid of your leg pain or we can drop down your anxiety or if you live with the anxiety that you have in the rest of your life, that probably will get worse or any can, I'm sorry, get rid of your leg pain and live with the anxiety. We get rid of the anxiety and live with your leg pain. All of them instantly grab the leg and said, well, if you get rid of the leg pain, won't they help my anxiety? The answer is clearly no. It's a separate issue. So every one of them says, I can't tolerate the anxiety. They would, they would rather sort of deal with the leg pain than deal with the anxiety. So at that point, then two weeks later, two people in New York who had multiple surgeries and their spines were certainly damaged. I was really working on, again, a ridiculous pain. There was a scar tissue. I was trying to find reasons to do surgery on these guys and the same thing came up that they're both incredibly stressed and really it was the anxiety or after not the leg pain. So from that point on, I started realizing that the mental pain was a bigger problem than the physical pain. Then last week, answered a question about 15 years where Dr. Lane pointed out that the body doesn't look tolerate emotional pain that it'll actually choose physical pain or make up physical pain rather than deal with emotional pain. So what I'm doing as a physician is asking people to give up their physical pain so they could feel emotional pain which they tolerate even less. There's a tremendous resistance in the chronic pain world that people are giving up their pain. So Dr. Lane's paper answered a huge question. With my own ordeal, who most of you know about some detail from my book, Back in Control, I was socially isolated which is a big problem. I had 17 different physical mental symptoms. I've learned through this group that anxiety depression, OCD are all inflammatory metabolic disorders which I had no idea. I went to psychotherapy for 13 years and things got way worse and rate punishes non tonight. He'll look at this a little bit later but Ray and I was sitting on the chronic hobby shop and just go over the over how can I go from a fearless surgeon, truly fearless to crippling anxiety in one day. It may now sense to me. So I was in talk therapy once in twice a week for 13 soluteers. That's a lot of therapy. The thing is got way worse. The worst part of the process was the unpleasant repetitive thoughts that became just like missiles coming out of me every five to 10 seconds almost. And I never had them during surgery because I was so involved with the surgery that didn't seem to affect that. If for a long time it wasn't a problem in clinic, you said it was the last two years to become intolerable. Then in 2002, I started a suicide attempt. So one of my fellow fellows, one of my fellow fellow spine surgeon and committed suicide, two of the fellows at Minneapolis and committed suicide. I have 20 medical colleagues that are from suicide. The worst part of my process was my inability to escape these unpleasant thoughts. It turns out, I'm not going to show it tonight, but there's many research papers linking ruminations to suicide. And the common denominator in repetitive thoughts, but I think the common denominator in suicide in general is just being trapped. And I would tell you when you're that trapped, it's actually logical way out. I would tell you right now today, if I had to live with that degree of unpleasant thoughts coming out of me that hard, I would still choose to commit suicide. It was intolerable. But it can be finances, relationship, money, poverty, chronic pain, by the way, does have a firm on a suicide. I had two patients commit suicide on a doctor, Franklin's series of surgical patients in state of Washington, nine people committed suicide. And so I don't know if it's a physical pain or mental pain that trapped in them, but the common denominator is trapped. It might be the only way out. So we're pitting up unpleasant thoughts. I'm going to, DR, I'm going to talk about this because there's a lot of science behind this. And I was going to define this simply your conscious brain is about firing off unpleasant thoughts. And the mental mechanics, there's two things. It's the interaction between your nervous system and your physiology, creates your thoughts. And you have conscious and unconscious part of your brain. And what drives these thoughts when I'm finding out is the unconscious brain. So what happens is that there's a, the famous paper doctor, Wagner, 1994, that showed, of course, when you try to suppress negative thoughts, they become stronger. It's called the white bears experiment. And not only do these thoughts become stronger, they become a lot stronger. It's a trampoline effect. And so it turns out that your demons are actually who you are and not. The problem is the most well-intentioned people are the ones that have the problem. So high level professionals in any field have more problem with these thoughts and people that are sort of associated with path. So we suppress more, we interpret more thoughts as bad. And so then you give meaning to them. And we give meaning to any physical sensation you've not created an neurological link. So again, we know, we all know this, but it's well documented over and over and over again that you suppress your thoughts, it becomes stronger. But what's really perverse, I think, and this were, DR, hop in here for a second, you have your cognitive brain, which is one fraction of the strength of your threat physiology. And you can't control your physiology and you can't control your thoughts. So if you try to think positive thoughts, like I want to be happy, where I want to be compassionate, you actually end up being the opposite. You actually end up being sad. If you try to be sad, you end up being happy. And the reason for that again, they did this in the lab. I don't remember the details right this second, but your conscious brain is a fraction of the unconscious brain. If you focus on happy, you can't maintain it. It's a conscious construct. And you're unconscious brain is just doing this thing all the time. So your conscious brain is monitoring how you might not be happy. So your brain goes towards not happy. Additionally, conscious idea that I'm going to be happy or do good deeds to whatever, you get cognitive fatigue. So if you're not particularly stressed out or feeling energized, people are reasonably good about creating the life that they want, staying on what they want to do, but under stress, it all starts to break down. So you have cognitive fatigue trying to outweigh the unconscious brain. So either way, just the pure mental mechanics actually caused these thoughts to become stronger. What's tragic for the human race is that the most well-intentioned people who could do the most good in the world are crippled by anxiety. And if you notice, I don't know, what percent of world leaders are someone sociopathic, but sociopaths aren't suppressing like people that are well-intentioned. It's a huge problem for the human race. So the best people just get taken out by anxiety. So D.R. you want to mention about the whole cognitive fatigue thing versus unconscious brain. So one final thing about the unconscious brain that Wagner pointed out in the 1990s is that your brain likes motion and movement. In other words, it's looking for things that are moving in dynamic. And a conscious concept is static. So your unconscious brain is picking up all sorts of cues all the time and sort of again protecting you from not achieving what you want to achieve. And so it's again the big mismatch. Your conscious brain becomes a T. Your unconscious brain just does what it's supposed to do. It doesn't do any extra energy to monitor your safety or threat because this is what it's supposed to do. So D.R. you've had some comments about cognitive fatigue that I think you're really relevant. Yeah, let me do a little bit of background and kind of get to get. We know that people when when we experience cognitive fatigue, our physiology goes towards a threat physiology. We produce more threat cytokines. So that has all kinds of implications in education and work a work day and you know how we lead our lives now more in our heads than experiential in the world. But I think the thing that I wanted to point out is that if we kind of look at thoughts a little bit like emotions. So let's say our emotions are physiology that get when they get to our cortex, they get represented as feelings. And that's in kind of an older cortex. I believe it's insular, single-it cortex kind of in that interoception area of our brain which is much older. But humans have really unique ability to think and form constructs and play with them in our heads. But they still represent our physiology getting to our neocortex probably mainly the Dorsal Lato prefrontal cortex is where we really create these types of thoughts and constructs that end up haunting us. So they bubble up just like our emotions bubble up and we can repress our emotions or compartmentalizer, denier thoughts as well. But what ends up happening is when these things you know want sort of permission to get out. And I don't remember the study exactly on repression and suppression, but I remember the some of the details of it when they want to kind of get out. But our prefrontal cortex is you know has all you know we have all kinds of social constructs contracts and cognitive constructs and narratives that then we put to our thoughts and they become beliefs. And when all of those things are not in alignment or not allowing the natural flow of our physiology to sort of be expressed, you get this phenomenon that that that there is sort of inhibition going on the prefrontal cortex probably if we have a narrow site gone probably medial prefrontal cortex plays a major governing role around all of these you know social contracts and narratives and constructs and all that. And what ends up happening is that registers just like any form of conflict in our brain in the anterior single cortex that then feeds down to lower centers and the amygdala down to lower centers. So we actually get a threat response, a vote from the thoughts. Now we I think we have to understand that the thoughts are just you know sort of bubbles that come up and and you know pop into our heads. We're not really in control of that process, but then we try to format them into you know something that fits into social norms and image of ourselves and all kinds of stuff that we try to do with those thoughts even though they're just sort of bubbling through us. And I think that's where the you know conflict arises literally within us. So I don't think our thoughts are actually toxic. I think they just are I think it's what what we do with our distinctly human brain with our thoughts that ends up feeding back into the system and creating conflict thus a threat response and makes us sick. So in a little bit more simpler terms why you know your brain creates thoughts then your thoughts become their own input. And you know this might be a simplistic but to me thoughts unpleasant thoughts are input repressed thoughts are even more powerful input. Your emotions are physiology what you feel and we know the dynamic healing model you have the input, your nervous system and the output. And so your thoughts it can escape your thoughts again you suppress and they become stronger you try to think positive thoughts you have cognitive fatigue. So the bottom line is you end up with sustained threat physiology. Well it's sustained for for physiology and again do you ever come in this again is that there's a lecture on a stand for the point that I've heard a year ago that half your brain is the immune system with glial cells etc. Your brain itself becomes inflamed and your transmitters go to excitatory sub inhibitory. You are actually metabolism goes up you're consuming fuel you're in an antibiotic state and your stress hormones in general are fired up and dear I think you pointed out that when your adrenaline levels hit a certain level or an adrenaline is a certain level your low affinity receptors get filled up and then and your neocortex or thinking brain gets down regulated. So there's a lot going on in your brain in in threat physiology. The problem is is that your thoughts for their physiology the physiology creates the thoughts and what's happening is that the thoughts are out here they're a fracture of the power of the unconscious brain and it's like shaking a hornet's nest and they're out here and you're trying to deal with the hornet's water where the reality is quit shaking the nest. You know we're just flat out content so what's happened in them so again my intrusive thoughts are gone. People that go through the process I put them through the thoughts of way down are gone. I talked to a friend of mine who came to me with severe intrusive thoughts for 15 years and going through the process of actually addressing physiology is intrusive thoughts are simply gone. So I don't have intrusive thoughts. I didn't have the crazy little disturbing thought I had before I get sick and I talked to another person who's in charge of a major mental health system in the South and in and also with his other psychologist friend of mine that to actually solve intrusive unpleasant thoughts are is unheard of. You can manage them but the problems were dealing with cognitive processes when the driving force is the physiology. So the other is going a little bit about physiology because I think it's been missed here so we look at an anxiety in terms of a psychological construct where it's just a manifestation of threat physiology. So it's a driving force not a cause. Yeah do you want me to so if we if we really dig dig deep on this like you know I like to do everything is determined by you know kind of the environment meeting our code and the exposome meeting our genome and so if if if we have threat out there and and I will argue that our thoughts are actually not the threat it's the way that we manage our thought that the thoughts becomes the threat. So getting way way down into the mud the exposome everything's an om now right metabolome proteome but the exposome meets the genome of which our thoughts you know feedback down based on how we handle them to create sort of a toxic super a threat physiology in us and and that then takes us through different phenotypes depending on the our threat load we experience the different phenotypes of threat and the classic ones you know that we think of our fight and flight. So if you're in fight that physiology is going to do a lot of different things immunologically metabolically everything but by and large fight is approach behavior you know we're we're irritable we're angry we may be rageful we may be explosive we may be we will be reactive and we're going to be aggressive but if that fails us then we tend to shift into flight which is a phenotype more characterized by things like retreat fear chronically with anxiety we become more vigilant we remain reactive and we become protective so in that vigilant state if that goes on chronically you can see chronic vigilance would look a lot like compulsion right and that can become maladaptive if we're and this is this is something that I think we we spend too much time talking about fight and flight because there are other phenotypes of threat you know that Steve Porges talks about the immobilization phenotypes where we become more immobile we start to falter we can't sustain fight and flight forever and it's in that falter phenotype where we want to hide we want to isolate we become a little depressed we become more paranoid we start to ruminate and that's where we become obsessive and when you come avoidant there and and so in that state and you can imagine kind of rubbing back and forth between flight and and and falter you know sort of this this anxious to depress state and and how that governs not only how we feel you know emotionally but also governs how we think what our thoughts are what they're biased towards and so when we get into an immobilization response that's where we are stuck right we we're inflexible both mentally and physically and when we're when we're stuck when we're in Dave's rot right the repetitive unwanted thoughts we're stuck that's where we feel trapped and and we can't seem to shake ourselves out of it right we can't physically get out of it we can emotionally get out of it and we can't get out of the thoughts that are bubbling you know bubbling through us so I think that's that's sort of you know that's the few of the phenotypes of threat and how how our emotions change our behavior change our posture changes but our thoughts also change because they're a product or a physiology and I think you know like with the skits of phrenic is probably the the best example of the idea that we really cannot control our thoughts they percolate and bubble up through us and then you know it depends what what we do with them at that point whether we get you know kind of mired down in a rut or not so what's been striking to me is that I didn't really catch this before so anxiety is one thing but these rats have always again repetitive and pleasant thoughts or in one of the thoughts these rats have always seem to be a lower different animal than actual the physiology there's something a little different about it so people can actually feel as anxious sometimes when they're calmer these thoughts run around even more and a lot of times let's you know a lot of people stay busy just to outrun their thoughts but you can't run your thoughts so again we express them we get stuck we repress them they we get even more fired up and then the data shows that under stress these thoughts increase more now this is some pleasant to you or maybe compare with which you just said I may not be exactly the right thing but when you're trapped your body fires up even more which fires off more thoughts more thoughts more stress so it's my personal theory that the inability to escape or conscious is I call it a cursa conscious is actually drives all chronic disease in Bob Navio who sent me the link me all day really simply said that the mitochondria cannot differentiate between a physical threat and a mental threat so remember our bodies I know we've gone from top down bottom up time discussions over and over again and they're both important but I don't know about the de-art first again I mean the cells learn to survive at the single cellular level and so when you when you organize into a mammal especially humans every cell is on his fighter either either a safe-tier threat and so at the single cellular level your cells want to survive so it's fascinating to me that we know that chronic stress causes physical illness sometimes illness and disease and I remember hearing that medical school and go well what do you mean because I mean you know a huge stress can be bad but people can tolerate a huge stress rest and regenerate and take on another huge stress with chronic stress there's no break you don't have time to refuel you don't have time to rest you regenerate so the chronic stress status been around forever and again until we started this group with the physiology of disease in general you know it started out as chronic pain but turns out that again we know 100% this is not every chronic disease autoimmune cancer osteoporosis Alzheimer's Parkinson's anxiety depression OCD the list is endless now you as brought all these together in a single let's say single but mitochondria breakdown and inability heal is a common factor with all chronic physical mental disease so that to me is completely unexpected so you have a brain that's in threat physiology it's not getting to rest not getting to regenerate you're not sleeping well you can't even have to get out the waste products at night through the lymphatic system and so we also found out for instance the pay-proud of Israel that shows that lack of sleep actually causes chronic low back pain why would it why would that be so again under stress you're cognitive you're conditioned you're fatigued you can't really cope with the unconscious brain which is going to do it's going to do no matter what you do consciously to mismatch and so the dead at least the dead I haven't gone into deeply into the dead of deer but under constant chronic threat these thoughts fire up even more is that a fair statement? I think I think a good statement or a run that might might be that we're we're constantly producing thoughts but it's the the bias that occurs in the thoughts that they get biased towards being protective so those like I said those responses are being more vigilant being more obsessive and the thoughts become in some ways more threatening to us so I think we do so it's it's not that our thoughts get fired up it's that our thoughts get biased towards bad shits going to happen and and that and then whatever we do with that you know it can become maladaptive so I the reason I'm hesitating a little bit is that there's a general slowing that occurs as you you know move in from sort of flight into this falteries state where you know you get the cognitive fog as well and and so you know the thoughts are definitely biased towards more negativity but whether they're coming through at a faster rate I'm not sure I see now that that makes sense I don't I get I'm thinking this is all sort of new stuff to me in a way but anyway so it's my theory that the inability to escape our thoughts I call the curse of consciousness is what drives chronic disease period now there's other things like you know trapped by finances relationships etc. I think and also keep you in sustained refugee but you know there's not many other species of creatures that develop all these chronic diseases like we do I mean if you're physically deprived on a physical threat why they're obviously going to get set animals do have diseases and cancer and stuff but they don't have the stress that they're ongoing consciousness that keep count at them so in the mental health world these are considered unsolvable and I simply don't have them a lot of people have worked to simply don't have them and again the mental health role is considered revolutionary and I think what's been missed is that we categorize anxiety and anger as psychological situations instead of physiological states and so if your regional premise of all your mental health treatment is based on a wrong premise then it's going to keep going the wrong direction really bad data on bad data on bad data and so by so when people now are dealing with aggressive thoughts or of intrusive thoughts that the key issue is we address the physiology the thoughts start to drop down there's a thought drop down the physiology drops down and but it's the lack of address the physiology I think is what's been driving this process and made it technically untreatable so calming down threat physiology is a major factor in solving the problem no what's about I think it's sort of a four-step solution I'll mention in a second I think we you know could point out here too that the reason it I mean the chronic repetitive thoughts and obsessive compulsive disorder are not yet well understood and there's all like I was saying earlier there's all kinds of theories going all the way back to Freud and anal neuroses and things like that right but one of the one of the problems that I think we I think that we see in in terms of talk therapy is that you know we're we're living in the world of the neo cortex we're living in the world of you know complex human language and we're living in the world of thoughts of reframing thoughts and and so we're so we're trying to sort of rationalize why you don't need to have these thoughts we're we're we're putting the cognitive load on somebody trying to cure their thought disorder with more thoughts and that's not likely to it seems logical but it's not likely to succeed because it is this threat physiology and and that's one area that I'd be slightly different than than I definitely the human neo cortex plays in how we operate plays a big role in why we have chronic illness and disease but ultimately it's chronic threat and the chronic threat response the physiology of chronic threat which is inflammatory and is catabolic and you know takes us through this this this phenotypic transformation to the point where we eventually will you know collapse and and become catatonic if it goes on too long so I think we have to focus on the fact that if we shouldn't be trying to cure the thoughts correct the thoughts reframe the thoughts we should simply be looking at the total threat load and treating that and in doing that as we shift their physiology out of a threat response their thoughts will clean up along the way they're just going to come as the phenotype changes the the thoughts will change too so I'm going to take about another five minutes to summarize the solution we're not going to detail in that because I really really want to hammer form the problem because when you understand the problem the solution is actually as the people say it's disturbingly simple so by not addressing physiology it's actually impossible to solve can't do it and we guess what we don't but in medicine in general again in spines or we we're doing back pain on normally aging disk we're back pain clearly my back pain has been documented being neurological disorder neurochemical disorder I mean that's a long story so we you know there's a thing called medically unexplained symptoms which is absolutely wrong symptoms are created by physiology and motion so if you look at the symptoms created that are quote medically unexplained it should be medically explained symptoms because the physiology is off there is something wrong so the same thing with these mental disorders the physiology is off if we don't address the physiology it doesn't matter what else we do so again your stresses or circumstances are translated into physiology translated into symptoms we're treating only symptoms we don't know where patients their circumstances we don't know their coping skills we don't know if the threat physiology or not we don't help them break it the physiology we're treating only symptoms and it's no wonder the burden of chronic disease continues to rise because sustained threat physiology causes symptoms illness and disease so this here's the solution and there's a bunch of parts to this we'll just touch on briefly and then maybe work backwards for a second well there's some good questions on the side bar right now already there's four parts to healing is if you cannot control your thoughts but you can do what's called thought diversion which is expressive writing simply separate from your thoughts I'm trying to control them mindfulness switches your your attention from raising thoughts is a simple a different sensation now fighting them and cognitive restructuring can also be a benefit cognitive behavioral therapy is going to really bad wrap in the chronic pain world because it quote doesn't work well nothing works by itself mindfulness has shown to actually break up mental rigidity which is a transdiagnostic psychological diagnosis mental rigidity is for your repetition of your thoughts creating concepts to become embedded in your brain to become very concrete so mentor rigidity is a common transdiagnostic psychological trait again mindfulness actually breaks it up so you so thought diversion is a step second thing is there's a bunch of ways of calming down the physiology and we talk about mindfulness meditation humming running your forehead the different polyvagal things we've talked about like the sounds see if it's a protocol bring your nervous stimulation soft touch acupuncture massage etc anything that calms down your anger is a big deal I have a whole process called anger processing which we won't go into tonight I don't like the word forgiveness it's a word that's too big it doesn't you can't forgive enough people come under physiology that's stress one of itself but the way you lower anger is simply lower your stress response so again thought diversion lower the refugee theology the real healing occurs as you move your brain into what you want creativity so I have a saying that to have a good life you to live a good life and the way we work now we're into fixing fixing fixing which actually is the arts point out reinforces the refugeeology your attention to the problem and that's where talk therapy by self-actress is pretty deadly as far as no plasticity and so as you learn to depersonalize stress physiology developing a working relationship with it is supposed to make you feel bad once you're not to take that personally then your brain can go over here and thrive there are two separate skill sets nurturing joy to try and Steve Cole show this in our group that if you live life in a hedonistic lifestyle your inflammatory markers go up you cannot outrun your brain so limit life is a sense of connection past and in purpose as a whole there's a ballgame which inflammatory markers go straight down so again creativity as you move away from the circuits is actually how you heal the final step is in this is really hard to explain I just talked to this friend of mine who's just done so well is dissolution of the ego so we have these survivor reactions that make us feel terrible they're a gift by the way and there's supposed to make you feel terrible you're developing working relationship with them but when you take those things personally they become your identity then you develop self-esteem or an ego we develop stories about yourself but self-esteem in and of a self-sake cognitive distortion are labeling so you have a million to one mismatch of the unconscious versus conscious brain all the self-esteem the world is not going to actually solve that so we develop these stories about ourselves to make ourselves better about ourselves it's a judgment pattern without an endpoint so then we spend all this time or cognitive energy trying to maintain this facade I was pretty good at this for a very long time and then I guess probably DR we call cognitive fatigue it just crumbled and I my ego was totally stripped down so we spent a lot of energy putting up this facade but the problem in this way I think I'm going to sound grandiose here per second this might be another phase of the human evolution because physical survival and emotional survival are the same thing they're in similar circuits we know how to physically survive as a species because we're here but it's mostly about power and control same thing with the emotional pain which also hurts we use power and control we do really desperately things over the people based on the scene for power and control and try to escape this thing called anxiety and once you depersonalize this process you don't have to have an ego so the final phase of this is simply dissolution of the ego which you can't force it just sort of happens so the thing is right now humans are how to physically survive but we don't know how to emotionally survive don't know how to emotionally thrive so the survival reactions what I call a curse of consciousness well first of all your survival reaction is the gift of life then the thoughts generated by the unconscious brain I call the curse of consciousness but we do have a gift of consciousness called language choice art companionship so we have a massive gift of consciousness that once we can separate our survival reactions from our conscious state that's where people thrive at a level that they don't know what to do with including me so when you're not fighting out these survival reactions all the time you're free it's a remarkable experience and it's consistent but again going back to last week's lecture is that patients people don't tolerate emotional pain don't choose physical pain I'm asking to give up your physical pain so you can have emotional pain that doesn't work so getting people to engage whereas the air points are getting people's brains all line enough to actually think and feel safe enough to engage is a step that I have not figured out yet do you have any comments that we're open up to discussion at this point? yeah I just look at Dick made a comment about cognitive behavioral therapy and I may have overstated the lack of effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy I don't I think that reformatting thoughts has a role you know it clearly it clearly does but even when you look at how well cognitive behavioral therapy actually works and things like chronic pain or even an anxiety and depression it's still in the 20% kind of range so it's clearly not the the answer but I don't disagree with the idea that if you know if we can reformat our thoughts that's certainly going to help if we process our thoughts better and with you know with meditation you know if you look at your thoughts like their bubbles percolating up through the you know through the soup they're kind of slippery and fragile they may or may not represent reality you can play with them and bat them around a little bit you know they may float away and burst and you know if you don't cling to those those those thoughts you know that that is a form of both meditative and cognitive behavioral adjustment that's going to help but I would also state that if you have somebody who has a very very high threat load that can come from so many different directions cognitive reframing is not going to be adequate and I also believe that you also have to you have to set the table you have to get people to a place where they're relatively safe have relatively low threat physiology before cognitive behavioral therapy is going to be effective so if you front load cognitive behavioral therapy and somebody who's you know extremely stressed or as a high threat response and the threats are ongoing they're active they're acute that that cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if you introduce it then and and and I think that you know I see that plays out clinically I see so many people like Dave said 13 years of counseling that you know that it can actually backfire and and create a sense of fatigue and failure in people and so I I'm you know I think we want to keep cognitive behavioral therapy and meditation and things like that they need to be in the treatment algorithm right they they need to be there but they need to be loaded at the right time and we should have reasonable expectations like we should have reasonable expectations of serotonin reuptake inhibitors they're going to be as good as placebo to 20 plus percent effective depending on which study in when they're introduced and what else is going on so so so I would not be around so as David Burns book failure which was book based CBT that's probably saved my life so I get probably 6% better with the CBT but again remember it's just the one step is part of the cognitive thought to work part of it but if you nervous system still on fire is when I cross this anger threshold about six or eight months later that my symptoms started to really disappear so it's that the interaction between the physiology of the cognition and so we keep focusing just on the cognition and it's really critically important but again in isolation it hasn't worked very well so I'm a huge fan of CBT but it is part of the algorithm in terranum and yeah and for example it's schizophrenic right a lot of them they they'll know their thoughts they can they can even differentiate that their thoughts aren't really reality but until we you know provide them with you know sort of other aspects of safety in their in their lives that is trying to change their their thought bubbles when their physiology is in a certain way through cognitive behavioral therapy is not going to be very effective. Anyway dig here master of this physiological part of the brain which you've done for many years what are your thoughts on this process about the epithelic patterns and activated threat physiology? Oh so much to talk about first of all it's too bad that when we had Steve Hayes here he didn't really do much except an experiential because in acceptance and commitment therapy all the premises that you laid out are premises of act that you have no control over your thoughts feelings beliefs they're automatic but instead of using CBT which I'm not a fan of as I was saying there you use your frontal lobe to try and stop struggling with those automatic thoughts feeling beliefs the bubbles that come up so in act it's complete they completely agree with you David that these are completely uncontrollable and that they shouldn't even be battled with and what your job is is to stop struggling accept them and be try to be mindful of them and observe be a self observed use your use the evolutionary frontal to try to be self-observant one tool we have to kind of deal with this and act has been shown to be at least as good as CBT for many things in our world we use act together with a somatic therapy and totally go along with your perception of safety and now we have really good data that on people who practice 20 minutes a day of HRV by a feedback of slow diaphragmatic breathing at a very specific rate have massive increases in the amygdala to left prefrontal cortex affect regulation network exactly fits with what you're saying if you can somehow deal with inhibitory processes that are able to manage those bubbles that are coming up you have way better ability to regulate your affect and so on and so forth so I think that all fits together and also what forges is a told us all along that the threat physiology is ignored by most people but totally crucial that we lower threat physiology before we do anything and I think I think most people get that but it's not usually part of the training of psychologists they don't get it right well that's one reason we're here um Garrett could point out that he's been using the threat for safety approach and and watching people heal and people really heal that's just so frustrating it's a surgery right now um particularly I'm taught that you know emotional pain is not tolerated the body chooses physical pain so I'm actually doing certain people's anxiety basically which just doesn't work very well and so we're so structurally based with so much um physiology and neuro science involved with this it's unbelievable and again some of it hasn't really hit clinical experience you know I'm I'm just thinking it's something too along along these same lines is because the the the thoughts are very close to equivalency to our emotions they're both driven from our physiology and um and part of the the idea is not to repress your emotions but to you know to experience them acknowledge them and when we're getting negative emotions you know those are signals to us to do something different right they're signals to us to take our you know take our hand off of the the hot stove kind of thing and but we don't look at our thoughts that way but I think we should that when we're getting these you know negative thoughts coming through they're they they may not represent reality but they do represent physiology right and that that is a reality and and so I think we need to go hey I'm having a lot of you know just kind of negative bad bad thoughts and that type of thing and that should be a signal to us that we need to do something different um and I think awareness of that instead of clinging to the thoughts as being reality but the awareness that the the tone of the thoughts I guess is a reflection of our physiology it could clue us into doing something different versus you know trying to trying to put them into a narrative that makes sense for us and as you said the narrative frequently tries to save our ego as well and that's not helpful any comment is yeah I think going to Doug first on come back to you dick and then Jacob made sure what you're thinking with your all processes and Matt had a comment also so Doug do you have a comment yeah this is an interesting one so dogs are not as smart as wolves and they have outsourced a lot of their complex decision making to humans and they follow our orders and a lot of times anxious humans have anxious dogs David when you mentioned that chronic diseases don't sort of pop up in wild animals the same way they kind of do in dogs with cancers and other things uh when claustin you mentioned sort of the overall threat physiological load I don't know it's an interesting thought to think if you were able to manage the anxiety in a dog owner will the dog's chronic illnesses improve because they take their cues from their owner and they're carrying an anxiety by following their pack leaders tenor or emotional tenor so you know I don't know it's just it's something that came up that's probably not something that you guys were talking about before but I wanted to throw it out there because they really do take their emotional tone often from their owner and that means they're not choosing it but their your neocortex is shaping their lived threat experience David with our cat I mean if I'm upset I mean it's it's also a mirror neuron effect but I mean I I don't agree with David on this animal thing because I think we've seen it and and I totally agree with you Doug so that's all I'm saying. David you help me you just ruined my evening anyway. Well if you look at rescue dogs they're you know they are you know they had a lot of them add adverse childhood events and they are really susceptible to some interesting behaviors so has that been done by the way with dogs with high haze scores compared to those that without as far as I don't know Google it. Matt you know the comment that's a great comment Doug I think that's I I won't admit under continuous assault for 15 years that animals do have emotions I'll grant you that anyway Matt did you have a comment? I said that that question when you said that I can't hear you. You hear some of your volumes way down your your question was where to go. Would you say that all emotions not just anxiety are different physiological states? I'll ask that to Dick or D.R. or both. What was that? I missed that. I said would you say all emotions not just anxiety are different physiological states? Dick what do you think? Yeah they're they're phenotypic states on the you know and they're on the threat safety sort of continuum we're never constant we're always changing. So it's tricky because we've tried for years to physiologically characterize different emotions and that's so easy to do but clearly there's some different processes and different emotions that we can measure easily and there's a lot of argument about central processing what that looks like so. Okay thanks Steve Mejuska. So I'm not a psychologist or work in that realm but I want us to consider context namely the country in which we live. The United States is among the top three or four stressed countries in the world. So we are a very highly stressed society. How does that play out? You know we also have perhaps the most mental illness of all countries. What are your opinions David's on context the country in which we live? I think that's a great question for D.R. talked about this a lot so it's digger birds where I when I write my materials I really conscious to honor people that are homeless poverty, lack of opportunity. I mean those are I mean right now you know we're in a massive crime way with no police protection and so all a sudden I'm under threat that I've never been on before. So I'm just a fraction of what people for running the world are under. It's a living and a chronic physical threat state is pretty darn brutal. So I mean the contrast is you take these superstars and have tens of millions of dollars have everything they still commit suicide and do all sorts of stuff. I mean you can't outrun your thoughts. So I still think that's always a factor no matter what. Then you add on the social stress factors it becomes I think intolerable. I don't know D.R. what do you think this or something? Oh boy that you know that yeah that that's a big issue for me because I believe in the big threat load right you know generational historical ecological physical financial social mental emotional cultural you know threat comes in in in many different forms and and what we tend to do in medicine is is focus on the individual you know and we vaguely have this concept of the social determinants of health right that nobody ever really addresses they're they're in our you know they're in our charting because they have to be but they're barely addressed but that that is you know a huge part of the threat load so you know if you look at the United States in terms of our culture our culture is one that is that we have based it on the concepts of conflict and competition right that is you're gonna gonna solve everything we're gonna get to the survival of the fittest that way and yet the survival of the fittest leaves the fittest tattered and torn and destroys everybody else and and so that but that's an ever present theme in our culture and I think it it argues to why Americans have such poor health and that's across the board you know and and I've heard me say this before but I think obesity is a threat related disorder it's it's a it has very little to do with the amount of exercise we get or the nutrition we put in it's not a killer calorie in versus kill a calorie out but it has more to do with threat load versus safety load but you know just across the board it's not just physical health it's it's it's mental health and we're we're suffering because we we've adopted that as you know it's it's just the underlying theme of of Americans that you know we're gonna fight our way and compete our way out of everything but we we live in a world of chronic threat and we're not we're getting it's getting worse you know if you if you go down that list in the United States you know things like inequity and particularly income now you know three three individuals have more wealth in the body at the bottom 50% of the population and so you know this is not about character right it's not about character brain defects this is just about phenotype the the under more threat you're going to see more anti social and a social behavior and that's just the way it is and and if we could shift the paradigm to one that you know focused a little bit more like the you know the Scandinavian countries on collaboration cooperation adaptation compromise you know see see the house completely incapable of that we we could have a major effect on people's health so all of this all of the little biohacks we're doing with vagal stem and you know given people pro-Zach and all that it pales in comparison to addressing the other components so you know I think you've all seen this statistic but 20% of determinants of health are affected by the clinical care that we provide right the other 80% of the determinants of health are all the other threats out there that we barely look at because we just focus on fixing that individual and that's why it's so difficult to make progress with people with you know pro-Zach and and cognitive behavioral therapy and things like that because we're only addressing 20% of the problem we're not getting to the other 80% so that's I think that's a huge issue and I think it needs the illumination that you know we we have to do we have to do better and our leadership is didn't understand the biology of all this I don't think so we get closed down here Jacob I want you to come in for me in a second but my is your conscious brain is fired up throwing off a lot of unpleasant thoughts we're trying to come back combat unpleasant thoughts with good thoughts which is impossible and so the key issue key issues is turning down the heat is then that allows the gift to consciousness language our companionship actually to thrive which actually is a solution and so basically dealing with threat load again deer aptly put out this societal use of threat so anytime you're anxious or frustrated you're reacting to something in the past today you're acting something came up today that you're perceiving the past as dangerous or was dangerous so you're reacting and so you're just running from circumstances running from poverty running from relationships but you also trying to run through your thoughts and what you're trying to do is actually slow down this is what meditation does is create a bit of space so you can see first calm things down and become creative so right here is the essence of the solution learning to calm down be with your thoughts they're not going to hurt you I mean your thoughts aren't going to hurt you and that's a huge huge factor and that's what's been missed again the basic paradigm that anxiety and anger are psychological states instead of different phenotypes of threat physiology are whole premise retrieval to help us simply wrong so it's a solvable problem I've helped dozens of people out of it personally I'm also finding out that people have gone through sort of this calming process their implicit thought patterns drop down dramatically so Jake you know comment because I do think that all is sort of the final solution once you sort of deal with each other issues Jake you there yeah can you hear me yeah yeah um two thoughts one I think it's a mistake to think of this as either or physiology or thoughts I think it's a both end oh yeah we need to deal with both and I think the starting the starting point for me is about reducing the threat load that that's the entry point and where our research on awe has been so powerful what it documents is two key things that relate to what you're saying one is connection connection is one of the primary ways to reduce threat load and then also induces a reduced sense of ego I wouldn't say in elimination of ego I think that's a grandiose goal that paradoxically has a egotistical quality to it what do you mean Jake I have no ego come on I challenge you Dave as you're running as you're running this group right I'm enlightened yeah so I think I think if we come back to these basics and think first how do we connect with people in connecting we're lowering the threat load and that opens up the possibility to work with people including helping them work with their thoughts and David's presented some ways that we can do that and there are of course many other ways so I agree I you know just I think this maybe getting out there but and I know you want to wrap it up but I do want to point out that the that the state of self right the ability to identify yourself is is primarily there to defend right if you look at the very first life form on earth you know as we call life anyway it had a boundary right a cell membrane and it could identify itself it knew enough to to protect itself so whenever we are in a self-focused mode we are technically in a defensive state when we lose threat we don't have to defend ourselves we don't have to defend our boundary anymore and and so when you know when we kind of lose our self and the other whether it's other people or nature or music or you know in a moment of awe and the self is not needed because we feel extremely safe that is that's where we that's where we can heal and so I just want to mention that that doesn't really have to do with ego but when we do a lot of self-focused therapy we may be maintaining the threat response even more than when we do and we don't do this I don't think very much of other focused therapy right of the connection you're you're talking about and then the ego is a difference of false self in my mind you know it's it's not a real self doesn't need to be defended but the health the healthy ego can also or can also contribute to great creativity which is part of David's strategy in terms of healing so so Dikver is all that you have the world thanks Jake that was really nice Dikyemi fell comments on this whole thing you have a pretty big perspective here although those were good summaries I was going to just say in line with supporting DDR and Steven we're just publishing a study looking at baseline hardware variability in African-Americans and what we found is that perceived discrimination lifetime perceived discrimination independent of all other cardiac risk factors is a very strong predictor of their baseline hardware variability accounting for about 40 some percent of the variance and hardware variability is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all disease so just that one little perception in one group which is really an extreme version of what DDR and Steven we're talking about has a incredibly powerful physiological effects and I think it's really super important that one of the things I do believe we are missing in you know when we talk about institutional racism and the effects on on minority health we're we're attributing a huge load are a huge part of poor outcomes and poor health to institutional racism and prejudice itself but there's physiology like for example like we don't give as good of care but there is this underlying physiology pro and flammatory catabolic threat response poor heart rate variability that that minority communities live with that actually probably has more to do with determining their ill health and poor outcomes than the racism within the institutions it's not to say we should ignore that but we need to focus more on the disenfranchisement the discrimination the inequities to improve their health we need to focus on that more than than trying to correct the racism within the institutions and I'm not giving me or you know institutions a you know a free pass there there's a lot of work to be done but the dialogue that we primarily see out there around that issue has more to do with the poor care that's provided and a little bit of animosity between and fear my minority communities of going to get healthcare but there's a whole another dynamic to it that is that is a societal issue a cultural issue well get rid of being labeled a chronic pain patient that's what yeah we don't have data on that but I mean it puts you in vagal withdrawal and long-term vagal withdrawal is bad for you in so many ways right so all the things we've been talking about but I thought that was a striking example that's very the correlations were really strong like 30 some percent of the variance and hungry variability really knocked your socks off wow all right thank you everybody lots of good and put this is a discussion to be continuing we sort of really scratch the surface night so there's lots of different layers to this and I'm excited about it and thank you for attending thank you David\n{{TRANSCRIPT
