# CLI Pipeline Health Check Summary Report

## Task Status
**Task ID**: #6e989b58-5dbf-4f35-a132-03f5872e2df5  
**Objective**: Carefully check all the health-checks for each cli pipeline - that in the registry

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented and improved health checks across all 26 CLI pipelines:
- **Initial Status**: 50% success rate (13 healthy, 13 unhealthy)
- **Final Status**: 62% success rate (16 healthy, 10 unhealthy)
- **Improvement**: Fixed 3 additional pipelines through systematic troubleshooting

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Added Health Checks to All Pipelines
- Created `safe-add-health-checks.sh` script to add basic health checks
- Successfully added health-check commands to all 26 CLI pipelines
- Integrated health checks with command tracking system

### 2. Fixed Common Issues
- **ROOT_DIR vs PROJECT_ROOT**: Fixed variable naming inconsistencies across all pipelines
- **tsconfig.node.json Path**: Corrected path references in tracking functions
- **Table Renaming**: Updated references from old table names (e.g., `experts` → `expert_profiles`)

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tools
- `fix-root-dir-issue.sh` - Fixes $ROOT_DIR references
- `fix-all-root-dir-issues.sh` - Comprehensive fix for all ROOT_DIR issues
- `diagnose-health-checks.sh` - Diagnostic script for troubleshooting failures

## Current Pipeline Status

### ✅ Healthy Pipelines (16)
1. AI Service
2. Authentication
3. Command Tracking
4. Database
5. Dev Tasks
6. Document Processing
7. Drive Filter
8. Git Workflow
9. Google Sync
10. Media Processing
11. MIME Types
12. Monitoring
13. Refactor Tracking
14. Script Analysis
15. Scripts Management
16. Work Summaries

### ❌ Unhealthy Pipelines (10)
1. **Classification** - TypeScript compilation errors
2. **Deprecation Analysis** - Missing implementation
3. **Document Types** - import.meta.env CommonJS issue
4. **Documentation** - Configuration issues
5. **Experts Management** - Table reference issues (partially fixed)
6. **Git Management** - Missing dependencies
7. **Merge Queue** - Configuration issues
8. **Presentations** - Database table issues
9. **Prompt Service** - Environment variable loading
10. **Worktree Management** - Missing implementation

## Remaining Issues

### 1. TypeScript/CommonJS Conflicts
Several pipelines fail due to `import.meta.env` usage in shared services when running in CommonJS context (ts-node).

### 2. Missing or Incomplete Implementations
Some pipelines have placeholder health checks that need proper implementation.

### 3. Database Schema Changes
Some health checks reference old table names that need updating.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix TypeScript Configuration**: Update shared services to handle both ESM and CommonJS contexts
2. **Implement Missing Health Checks**: Add proper health check logic for pipelines with basic implementations
3. **Update Database References**: Systematically update all database table references to use current names
4. **Add Health Check Monitoring**: Create a scheduled job to monitor health check status over time
5. **Document Health Check Standards**: Create guidelines for what constitutes a proper health check

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/safe-add-health-checks.sh`
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/fix-root-dir-issue.sh`
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/fix-all-root-dir-issues.sh`
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/diagnose-health-checks.sh`
- `/scripts/cli-pipeline/registry/update-health-check-status.sql`

### Modified
- Multiple `*-cli.sh` files to add health checks
- Fixed ROOT_DIR references in ~20 CLI scripts
- Updated table references in health check implementations

## Next Steps

1. Address TypeScript/CommonJS compatibility issues in shared services
2. Implement comprehensive health checks for the 10 remaining unhealthy pipelines
3. Create automated health check monitoring dashboard
4. Document health check best practices for future pipeline development
