# Maintenance CLI Pipeline Migration Summary

## Migration Date: 2025-01-14

## Changes Made

### 1. Base Class Migration
- Migrated from custom implementation to `SimpleCLIPipeline`
- Standardized command structure and help display
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Command Standardization
- Changed command pattern from function names to `command_` prefix:
  - `health_check` → `command_health-check`
  - `singleton_usage` → `command_singleton-usage`
  - `check_google_sync` → `command_check-google-sync`
  - `check_find_folder` → `command_check-find-folder`
- Added explicit `command_help` function

### 3. Location
- Script remains in `/scripts/cli-pipeline/` (not in subdirectory)
- Supporting files (health-check-services.js) remain in same location

### 4. Service Dependencies
- No new service dependencies identified
- Uses existing health-check-services.js for functionality
- Implements fallback checks when scripts are not available

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
- All original functionality preserved
- Commands work identically to original implementation
- Same verbose flag support maintained

## Testing Results
- ✅ Help command works correctly
- ✅ Command routing works properly
- ✅ Fallback implementations tested
- ⚠️ health-check-services.js has path issues (pre-existing)

## Notes
- The health-check-services.js script has pre-existing path resolution issues
- This is a simple pipeline that mainly calls other scripts
- Future enhancement: Consider migrating health-check-services.js to TypeScript service
