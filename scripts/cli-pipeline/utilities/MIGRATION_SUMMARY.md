# Utilities CLI Pipeline - Migration Summary

## Overview
**Pipeline**: utilities-cli.sh  
**Complexity**: LOW  
**Base Class**: SimpleCLIPipeline  
**Migration Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  

## Changes Made

### 1. Base Class Integration
- Migrated from custom implementation to SimpleCLIPipeline base class
- Leverages standard logging, error handling, and command routing
- Automatic command tracking with debug mode support

### 2. Improved Structure
- Commands now follow standard `command_<name>` pattern
- Consistent parameter validation
- Better error messages and user guidance

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Added 2 new commands discovered in directory:
  - `check-ports` - Check port registry configuration
  - `fix-vite-env` & `diagnose-vite-env` - Vite environment utilities
- Improved health check with service availability checking
- Better command organization and help documentation

### 4. Service Integration
- Documents missing services for future implementation
- Maintains full functionality with direct TypeScript execution

## Service Dependencies

### Available Services
- None currently used (utility scripts called directly)

### Missing Services (Documented)
- **FileSystemService** - Would provide:
  - Cross-platform file operations
  - Permission handling
  - File metadata management
  - Path manipulation utilities
  
- **UtilityService** - Would provide:
  - Common utility functions
  - String manipulation
  - Data conversion utilities
  - Shared helper functions

## Command Mapping

| Old Command | New Command | Status | Notes |
|------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| import-sqlite-tables | import-sqlite-tables | âœ… | Most frequently used |
| import-sqlite-data | import-sqlite-data | âœ… | Placeholder for future |
| migrate-cli-imports | migrate-cli-imports | âœ… | Migration utility |
| test-migration | test-migration | âœ… | Single migration testing |
| insert-work-summary | insert-work-summary | âœ… | Work tracking |
| track-commit | track-commit | âœ… | Git integration |
| standardize-categories | standardize-categories | âœ… | Database cleanup |
| archive-packages | archive-packages | âœ… | Package management |
| check-archived | check-archived | âœ… | Archive status |
| scan-app-features | scan-app-features | âœ… | Frequently used |
| N/A | check-ports | ðŸ†• | New command added |
| N/A | fix-vite-env | ðŸ†• | New command added |
| N/A | diagnose-vite-env | ðŸ†• | New command added |
| health-check | health-check | âœ… | Enhanced version |

## Breaking Changes
- None - All commands maintain same interface
- New commands are additions, not replacements

## Benefits
1. **Consistency** - Uses standard base class patterns
2. **Maintainability** - Cleaner code structure  
3. **Discoverability** - Found and added 3 undocumented commands
4. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new utility commands
5. **Observability** - Integrated logging and tracking

## Implementation Notes
- All TypeScript utilities are called directly via ts-node
- Debug mode properly filters out --debug flag before execution
- Health check validates all key utility scripts exist
- Help text preserves frequency indicators from original

## Next Steps
1. Implement FileSystemService for standardized file operations
2. Implement UtilityService for common utilities
3. Complete import-sqlite-data functionality
4. Consider grouping utilities into sub-categories

## Files Changed
- `utilities-cli.sh` - Refactored to use SimpleCLIPipeline
- `.archived_scripts/utilities-cli.20250614.sh` - Original archived
