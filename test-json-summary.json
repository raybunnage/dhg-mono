This is a shell command to update a prompt service with a new prompt definition, followed by the prompt content itself. The command is:

```bash
./scripts/cli-pipeline/prompt_service/prompt-service-cli.sh update --prompt-name "final_video-summary-prompt" --file-path "prompts/final_video-summary-prompt.md"
```

The prompt being updated is called "final_video-summary-prompt" and it defines an AI system for generating summaries of expert video presentations based on transcripts.

The prompt instructs the AI to:
1. Create structured JSON summaries of expert video presentations
2. Extract key information about the speaker, presentation content, and discussion
3. Generate engaging, vibrant summaries that help users decide which videos to watch

The JSON output format includes sections for:
- Speaker profile (name, title, expertise)
- Presentation essence (core topic, unique approach, etc.)
- Key takeaways (4 main insights)
- Memorable quotes from the speaker
- Discussion highlights from Q&A
- Target audience and unique value
- A 200-300 word narrative summary

The prompt emphasizes creating engaging, specific summaries that capture the energy and unique value of the presentation while maintaining accurate JSON formatting.
