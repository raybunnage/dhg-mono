# VITE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SOLUTION

## 🚨 THE SOLUTION IS NOW BUILT INTO THE APP

### Step 1: Visit the Fix Page
1. Go to http://localhost:5180
2. Click the red **"🚨 Fix Env Issues"** button at the top
3. The page will show you:
   - ❌ What's broken
   - ✅ How to fix it
   - 📋 Copy-paste commands

### Step 2: If You See Red Errors
The page will give you two options:
- **Quick Fix Button** (works 90% of the time)
- **Nuclear Fix Button** (works 100% of the time)

Click the button to copy the command, then paste it in your terminal.

### Step 3: Alternative - Run the Fix Script
```bash
# From project root, just run:
./fix-env-now.sh
```

## Why This Happens
- Vite caches environment variables in `node_modules/.vite`
- The cache gets stale and doesn't update
- Our fix clears the cache and forces a reload

## The Fix Page Shows You:
- Current environment variable status
- Which variables are loaded/missing
- Diagnostic results
- Copy-paste fix commands
- Manual troubleshooting steps
- A test button to verify the fix worked

## Trust But Verify
After running any fix:
1. Go back to the Fix Page
2. Click "🔄 Refresh Diagnostics"
3. Click "🧪 Test Supabase Connection"
4. Should see "✅ Connection successful!"
