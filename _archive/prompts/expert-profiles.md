## Robert H. Lustig, M.D., M.S.L.
### Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, UCSF

**Research Summary:**  
Dr. Lustig's groundbreaking work has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of metabolic health and its broader societal implications. As a neuroendocrinologist, he has pioneered research connecting processed food consumption, metabolic disorders, and public health outcomes. His recent work has expanded into investigating the role of the amygdala in what he terms the "syndemic" - the interconnected crises of systemic health, mental health, and societal health. His research has revealed crucial links between metabolic syndrome, depression, and broader societal issues, demonstrating how amygdala dysfunction connects to multiple public health challenges. Through his work at UCSF, he has established himself as a leading voice in the anti-sugar movement, drawing critical parallels between the food industry's practices and those of the tobacco industry in the 1960s. His research combines clinical insights with public health advocacy, particularly focusing on how processed food affects metabolism and broader social outcomes. This work has led to practical policy recommendations and public health initiatives aimed at improving metabolic health at a population level.

**Expertise Keywords:** metabolic health, sugar impact, processed food, public health, amygdala research, neuroendocrinology, obesity prevention

## Daniel Clauw, M.D.
### Professor of Anesthesiology, Medicine (Rheumatology), and Psychiatry, University of Michigan

**Research Summary:**  
Dr. Clauw's work at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center (CPFRC) has transformed our understanding of chronic pain conditions and their treatment. His research has established fundamental connections between autonomic nervous system function and nociplastic pain, particularly in fibromyalgia. With over 450 peer-reviewed publications and more than $100 million in federal funding, his research group has become one of the world's leading centers for pain research. His work is particularly notable for integrating multiple disciplines - rheumatology, anesthesiology, and psychiatry - to understand chronic pain mechanisms. The CPFRC, under his leadership, has pioneered new approaches to studying and treating chronic pain conditions, leading to the first NIH HEAL Interdisciplinary Team Science award. His research has been instrumental in shifting the paradigm of pain treatment from a purely mechanical model to one that considers the complex interplay of nervous system regulation, immune function, and pain perception. This work has particular significance for understanding conditions like fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes that have traditionally been difficult to treat or understand.

**Expertise Keywords:** chronic pain, fibromyalgia, pain research, autonomic dysfunction, nociplastic pain, interdisciplinary medicine

## Robert Naviaux, M.D., Ph.D.
### Professor of Genetics, UCSD

**Research Summary:**  
Dr. Naviaux's research has revolutionized our understanding of mitochondrial diseases and cellular healing mechanisms. As director of the core laboratory for metabolomics and exposomics at UCSD, his work spans genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors in chronic diseases. His groundbreaking discovery of POLG1 mutations as the cause of Alpers syndrome led to the development of the first DNA test for this condition, marking a significant advance in mitochondrial medicine. His lab's innovative work in metabolomics and exposomics has revealed common metabolic signatures across various complex chronic disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ME/CFS, and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Particularly significant is his research into purinergic signaling and its role in cellular healing cycles, which has uncovered fundamental mechanisms shared across multiple chronic disorders. His work includes directing the first FDA-approved clinical trial of suramin for ASD treatment, demonstrating the potential for metabolic approaches to neurodevelopmental disorders. This research has opened new avenues for understanding how cellular communication and healing processes contribute to various chronic conditions, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.

**Expertise Keywords:** mitochondrial disease, metabolomics, autism research, chronic illness, cellular healing, genetic disorders, purinergic signaling

## Satchin Panda, Ph.D.
### Professor, Salk Institute for Biological Studies

**Research Summary:**  
Dr. Panda's research has fundamentally advanced our understanding of circadian rhythms and their impact on human health. Through his work at the Salk Institute, he has pioneered investigations into how time-restricted feeding (TRF) affects metabolic health and longevity. His research has demonstrated that confining food intake to a consistent 8-10 hour daily window can serve as both a preventive and therapeutic measure for various chronic conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. His work has particularly illuminated how circadian rhythm disruption in our modern world elevates risks for chronic diseases, leading to practical interventions for population-scale health improvement. Through laboratory and human studies, he has shown how optimal timing of food intake and light exposure can significantly impact depression, mood, sleep quality, and even hospital recovery rates. His findings have been translated into practical applications through his books "The Circadian Code" and "The Circadian Diabetes Code," which have been translated into 15 languages, demonstrating the global impact of his research.
