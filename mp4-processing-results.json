      "summary": "Dr. Stephen Arwin delivers a masterful synthesis of his 40-year journey as a rheumatologist, revealing how his clinical intuitions are now validated by emerging neuroscience. Drawing from compelling patient stories and research evidence, he presents seven key principles for preventing chronic pain and inflammation: developing collaborative care models that foster co-regulation; treating inflammation aggressively early; recognizing both emotional and physical trauma as disease triggers; extending primary care with specialized expertise; treating to remission rather than symptom improvement; empowering patients to drive their own care; and personalizing treatment based on prognosis. Dr. Arwin illustrates how the autonomic nervous system, particularly vagal tone, serves as the foundation for healing, and how early intervention can prevent the transition from acute to chronic conditions. His patient-centered approach includes a phase model of chronic illness that adapts provider roles from healer to coach to counselor to partner as patients progress. The presentation brilliantly connects polyvagal theory, inflammatory pathways, and psychosocial factors into a comprehensive framework that challenges traditional medical paradigms. As healthcare evolves toward more integrated models, Dr. Arwin's insights offer a roadmap for clinicians seeking to prevent rather than merely manage chronic disease."

His work has fundamentally challenged the traditional view that chronic pain is simply persistent acute pain. Instead, his longitudinal studies reveal that chronic pain represents a distinct neurological condition with specific brain signatures. Most remarkably, his team has identified brain biomarkers that can predict with 60% accuracy which patients will develop chronic pain after an injury - an unprecedented level of predictive power in pain research. These markers include smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes, abnormal white matter pathways, and increased connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. As pain transitions from acute to chronic, brain activity shifts dramatically from sensory regions to emotional/limbic circuits, even while pain intensity remains stable. Contrary to clinical expectations, anxiety and depression levels don't increase as pain becomes chronic but remain consistent in those predisposed to chronic pain. Perhaps most surprisingly, chronic pain patients demonstrate not just suffering but enhanced coping mechanisms, scoring higher on positive traits like openness and conscientiousness than average. This research offers profound implications for treatment approaches, suggesting interventions might be most effective during the transitional phase before pain becomes a stable, difficult-to-disrupt neurological state."

He reveals that hypersensitivity is not psychological but neurological and cellular, stemming from three interconnected systems: limbic dysfunction, polyvagal dysregulation, and mast cell activation. These systems all monitor safety, and when triggered by factors like mold toxicity, Lyme disease, or EMF exposure, create a cascade of inflammatory responses. Dr. Nathan emphasizes that mold toxicity is the most common trigger, affecting an estimated 10 million Americans, and can be diagnosed through simple urine mycotoxin testing. His treatment approach follows a specific sequence: first addressing the neurological sensitivity through limbic retraining programs like DNRS or Gupta's Amygdala Retraining, then treating underlying triggers. He shares practical diagnostic tools and treatment protocols, including brain retraining programs, vagal nerve stimulation, and specific binders for mycotoxins. Throughout the discussion, Dr. Nathan stresses that establishing safety is paramount—patients cannot heal if they don't feel safe. This presentation offers hope to both clinicians and patients dealing with complex sensitivities, providing a comprehensive framework that integrates functional medicine, neuroscience, and immunology with practical clinical applications."

He introduces the Cell Danger Response (CDR) as the universal process cells use to combat threats, explaining how all stressors cause ATP to leak from cells into extracellular space where it acts as an alarm signal. This extracellular ATP, while necessary initially, must decrease for complete healing to occur. Dr. Naviaux reveals that chronic illnesses—from autism to chronic fatigue to depression—share a common root: incomplete healing cycles where cells remain stuck in danger signaling mode. His groundbreaking insight is that healing requires both turning off local danger signals and restoring cellular receptivity to remote safety signals from the nervous system and social connections. He connects this cellular biology to Hans Selye's work on stress and introduces 'salutogenesis' as the science of healing itself. The presentation culminates with promising therapeutic approaches that synergistically reduce extracellular ATP while enhancing safety signals through vagal stimulation and social connection. This revolutionary framework offers hope that seemingly incurable chronic conditions might respond to treatments targeting the healing process itself rather than just specific disease symptoms."

      "summary": "Dr. Robert Naviaux delivers a groundbreaking presentation on the cellular mechanisms of healing, centered on the critical role of mitochondria and ATP signaling. He explains that healing is not simply the reverse of injury but a choreographed three-phase process driven by different mitochondrial states (M1, M0, M2) that must occur in sequence. When cells are stressed or injured, they release ATP into the extracellular space, serving as a danger signal that triggers defensive responses. Dr. Naviaux proposes that many chronic conditions—from autism to chronic pain—may result from hypersensitivity to these ATP danger signals, preventing completion of the healing cycle. His research with the anti-purinergic drug suramin, which blocks ATP signaling, has shown remarkable results in children with autism who began speaking in sentences after treatment. The presentation challenges conventional medical thinking by demonstrating that removing the source of injury doesn't guarantee healing; the body must actively receive safety signals to complete the healing process. This framework explains why many chronic conditions persist despite conventional treatments and offers new therapeutic directions. The discussion with other experts, including Dr. Porges, explores fascinating connections between ATP signaling, vagal tone, and the neurobiology of safety, suggesting an integrated model of healing that spans from cellular metabolism to whole-body regulation."

As the founder of UCSD's Mitochondrial and Metabolic Disease Center, he brings decades of research to explain what medical school never taught him: healing is an active biological process, not a passive engineering one. Naviaux reveals how mitochondria—far more than just cellular power plants—change form and function when cells encounter threats, fragmenting from connected networks to isolated fragments while releasing ATP as a danger signal. This extracellular ATP triggers inflammation and communicates with the brain through the vagus nerve, creating a whole-body response. The brilliance of his model lies in distinguishing pathogenesis (how we get sick) from salutogenesis (how we heal), showing they follow different pathways. Healing requires a choreographed sequence involving different mitochondrial phenotypes that cannot be rushed or reversed. Most provocatively, Naviaux demonstrates that psychological and physical traumas create identical chemical signatures, explaining why emotional stress triggers physical illness. For the 60% of adults trapped in chronic conditions, this research offers hope by identifying specific blocks in the healing cycle that can be addressed. His work represents a 'second book of medicine' that could revolutionize treatment approaches by focusing on creating conditions of safety that allow the body's natural healing processes to function."

He introduces the cell danger response (CDR), where stressed cells release extracellular ATP as a danger signal, creating a cascade of metabolic changes. In chronic illness, cells become hypersensitive to ATP signaling, creating a persistent state that blocks healing signals from the nervous system. This explains why chronic conditions differ fundamentally from acute illness and require different treatment approaches. Dr. Naviaux presents a dual approach to healing: bottom-up strategies that desensitize cells to ATP signaling, and top-down strategies that provide rhythmic safety signals through the autonomic nervous system. He shares fascinating research showing how chronic illness patients exhibit measurable metabolic differences, including lower body temperatures and delayed hypersensitivity responses to stressors. The presentation offers a revolutionary framework for understanding conditions ranging from chronic pain to anxiety, explaining how physiological changes at the cellular level manifest as psychological symptoms. Most importantly, Dr. Naviaux's work suggests that combining approaches that address both cellular hypersensitivity and nervous system regulation could lead to breakthroughs in treating previously intractable chronic conditions."

Drawing on over two decades of research, she reveals how attachment patterns formed in childhood become powerful predictors of how we respond to pain and its treatment as adults. The presentation illuminates why individuals with insecure attachment styles—representing 60-70% of chronic pain populations—often struggle more with disability and show less sustainable improvement from standard interventions. Dr. Meredith explains that these patterns influence how patients appraise pain threats, seek support, and regulate emotions during painful episodes. The discussion expands into fascinating territory when Dr. Stephen Porges connects attachment theory to polyvagal theory and autonomic regulation, suggesting these frameworks observe the same underlying physiological mechanisms from different perspectives. What makes this presentation particularly valuable for clinicians is its practical application—understanding attachment patterns helps practitioners tailor their approach without blame, recognize why certain therapeutic relationships work better than others, and predict treatment outcomes. As one participant noted, this knowledge can transform frustration into compassion by recognizing that difficult patient behaviors aren't personal but rather adaptive responses developed early in life. For anyone working with chronic pain patients, this presentation offers a powerful lens for understanding treatment resistance and building more effective therapeutic relationships."

Dr. Whitaker, alongside polyvagal expert Dr. Stephen Porges, proposes that teaching medical students about the neurophysiology of social behavior could transform healthcare. Rather than viewing compassion as an optional soft skill, they frame co-regulation—the ability to help others feel safe—as a scientifically-grounded healing modality with measurable physiological effects. The discussion highlights how physicians broadcast signals through their nervous systems that patients cannot ignore, making self-regulation a prerequisite for effective healing relationships. Particularly compelling is the insight that dispositional mindfulness serves as a protective buffer against childhood adversity, suggesting that teaching regulatory skills could benefit both physicians and patients. This conversation offers a revolutionary vision where medical education begins with understanding healthy autonomic function rather than pathology, potentially addressing the crisis of physician burnout while simultaneously improving patient outcomes."

      "summary": "In this illuminating presentation, Matt Letterman shares his journey from conventional medicine to a revolutionary approach centered on connection and compassionate communication. Drawing from his personal experience overcoming chronic pain, Letterman introduces the 'Hands of Joy' framework that balances internal resources (sleep, nutrition, activity, play, self-awareness) with external connections. The heart of his approach is non-violent communication—a method for identifying and expressing feelings and needs without judgment or blame. Through engaging role-plays, Letterman demonstrates how this approach transforms potentially triggering interactions into opportunities for deeper connection. He introduces practical tools like the 'duck meter,' which ensures actions come from genuine willingness rather than obligation. What makes this presentation particularly valuable is how it bridges emotional and physical healing, showing how disconnection manifests as physical symptoms through autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Participants witness firsthand how changing communication patterns can immediately shift physiological states, potentially alleviating pain and other symptoms. For healthcare practitioners, chronic pain sufferers, and anyone seeking more authentic relationships, Letterman offers a refreshingly practical approach to healing that addresses both the biological and emotional dimensions of wellbeing."

      "summary": "In this groundbreaking presentation, Dr. Robert Lustig reveals how our society's confusion between pleasure (dopamine) and happiness (serotonin) is driving epidemics of both metabolic and mental health disorders. With compelling data, he demonstrates how diabetes rates have exploded beyond all projections while deaths of despair have risen dramatically, particularly since 2007 when smartphones became ubiquitous. Dr. Lustig explains the biochemistry behind these trends: sugar (particularly fructose) and technology both trigger dopamine release, which downregulates its own receptors, requiring ever-increasing stimulation to achieve the same reward. Meanwhile, these same factors damage the prefrontal cortex—our brain's brake system—leading to addiction, depression, and anxiety. The presentation includes a fascinating computational model of the limbic system that explains these connections and offers hope through the 'Four C's': Connect (in-person social interaction), Contribute (outside yourself), Cope (sleep, mindfulness, exercise), and Cook (real food). What makes this talk exceptional is how Dr. Lustig bridges biochemistry, neuroscience, and public health to explain seemingly disparate trends in society, offering a unifying theory of how modern life is literally rewiring our brains and bodies for disease. His insights on the mitochondrial effects of fructose and the critical distinction between pleasure and happiness provide a roadmap for both individual and societal healing."

      "summary": "Dr. Marilyn Sanders delivers a groundbreaking presentation on applying polyvagal theory to neonatal intensive care, revealing how traditional NICU environments can inadvertently harm vulnerable infants' developing nervous systems. While survival rates for premature infants have dramatically improved, social-emotional and cognitive outcomes remain concerning, with significantly higher rates of autism and relationship difficulties persisting into adulthood. Sanders explains how the NICU disrupts biological expectancies of both infants and parents through separation, unpredictability, and noxious stimuli, creating what Dr. Porges defines as 'trauma' - a chronic disruption of connectedness. The presentation illuminates how infants' autonomic states can be observed through physiological signs: ventral vagal safety (calm, engaged), sympathetic activation (tachycardia, agitation), and dorsal vagal collapse (the dangerous 'death spells' where babies shut down). Sanders advocates for relationship-based, individualized care that prioritizes parent-infant connection through skin-to-skin contact, single-family rooms, and understanding babies' behavioral communication. The discussion reveals profound implications beyond neonatology, connecting early autonomic dysregulation to conditions like autism, obesity, and stress disorders. This presentation offers a revolutionary perspective for healthcare professionals, showing how creating environments of safety and connectedness can fundamentally improve developmental trajectories by supporting healthy autonomic nervous system function from life's earliest moments."

      },
      "summary": "In this deeply personal and scientifically grounded presentation, Stanford psychologist Fred Luskin shares his journey from being stuck in bitterness to pioneering forgiveness research and interventions. After failing to heal from a personal betrayal despite his therapeutic training, Luskin developed a secular forgiveness methodology that has since been validated through rigorous studies, including work with people who lost family members to violence in Northern Ireland. His approach reframes forgiveness not as condoning wrongdoing or reconciling with offenders, but as a personal practice of changing one's narrative about painful events. The Stanford Forgiveness Project demonstrated significant reductions in anger, stress, and physical symptoms, while increasing hope and wellbeing. Luskin emphasizes that forgiveness is fundamentally about dealing with not getting what you wanted in life and learning to shift attention away from dwelling on wounds. The discussion with other experts reveals how forgiveness involves both physiological calming and cognitive reframing, with different people requiring different entry points to the process. What makes this presentation particularly valuable is Luskin's humility in acknowledging that after decades of work, he sees forgiveness as messier and more individualized than he initially thought, yet consistently powerful in its healing effects."

As a certified trainer in Non-Violent Communication, Matt recognized that even when people understand communication principles intellectually, they struggle to implement them when emotionally triggered. Working with co-founder Michael, a data scientist with a passion for emotional intelligence, they created an AI coach that guides users through conflicts in real-time. Through an impressive demonstration, Matt shows how the tool helps users identify feelings and needs, practice conversations through role-play, and draft connecting messages. What makes this approach revolutionary is how it bypasses the physiological triggers that typically escalate conflicts, allowing users to stay in a thinking rather than reactive state. The presentation sparked rich discussion about applications ranging from family conflicts to workplace communication, with touching anecdotes about children resolving disputes independently using the tool. While privacy concerns and questions about authenticity were raised, the group recognized the tremendous potential for this technology to enhance human connection rather than replace it. As one participant noted, this tool doesn't just solve problems—it creates a pathway for deeper understanding between people at times when they need it most."

      "summary": "In this compelling presentation, Kate Nicholson shares her unique perspective as both a clinician and a person living with multiple disabilities including MS. On her 40th birthday, she invites viewers into the often invisible experience of navigating healthcare with chronic conditions. Through powerful personal anecdotes and evidence-based insights, Nicholson illustrates how environmental factors in healthcare settings—from inaccessible check-in kiosks to examination tables patients can't climb onto—create significant barriers and cues of threat. She challenges providers to reconsider language, shifting from 'pain management' to 'pain care,' and emphasizes that no amount of medical imaging can reveal what it's truly like to live in another person's body. Nicholson offers practical strategies for creating cues of safety, including checking the environment for accessibility, practicing self-care before patient interactions, and simply asking patients what language they prefer. The discussion explores the complex relationship between embodiment and pain, with Nicholson sharing how she's learned to remain present with her pain rather than dissociating from it. This presentation is invaluable for healthcare providers seeking to improve patient experiences and for anyone supporting those with chronic conditions, offering a rare glimpse into both sides of the healthcare journey."

His analysis of common orthopedic procedures, including spine fusions, knee arthroscopies, and rotator cuff repairs, demonstrates that many widely-performed surgeries lack scientific validation despite their enormous costs. Harris explains how clinician bias, observation-based decision making, and financial incentives perpetuate ineffective procedures, noting that surgeons consistently overestimate benefits while underestimating harms. The presentation sparked rich discussion about chronic pain as a physiological rather than structural issue, with participants sharing how addressing the body's threat response often resolves pain without surgery. Harris offers practical solutions including multidisciplinary reviews, second opinions, and restructuring financial incentives. This eye-opening talk provides essential insights for healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers seeking to understand the true value of surgical interventions and the systemic changes needed to improve patient outcomes."

As an early pioneer in this field since the 1990s, he shares compelling evidence from his double-blind, placebo-controlled study showing that adding the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex) to standard antidepressant treatment significantly improves outcomes. Dr. Halaris explains the complex biochemical pathways through which inflammation disrupts neurotransmitter systems, particularly how inflammatory cytokines activate an enzyme that diverts tryptophan away from serotonin production. His research extends to genetic factors, demonstrating how specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence inflammatory responses and can predict which patients might benefit most from anti-inflammatory interventions. The presentation sparks rich discussion among neuroscientists and clinicians about the connections between inflammation, autonomic nervous system function, and brain imaging correlates, suggesting a coordinated threat response that encompasses multiple biological systems. Despite promising research, Dr. Halaris acknowledges the clinical challenges of implementing anti-inflammatory approaches in psychiatric practice, including FDA approval limitations. This presentation offers valuable insights for clinicians seeking more effective treatments for resistant psychiatric conditions and researchers exploring the complex interplay between inflammation and mental health."

Through compelling case studies, including a woman named Esti who became pain-free after years of suffering, the experts demonstrate how group settings that promote safety can trigger profound healing. Dr. Bernie Siegel adds powerful clinical stories that illustrate how human connection and changing one's personal narrative can transform physical symptoms. The discussion challenges traditional medical approaches that focus on symptoms rather than root causes, offering clinicians practical ways to understand how different interventions affect the input (sensory processing), nervous system regulation, and output (symptoms) aspects of chronic pain. This presentation provides a revolutionary perspective that explains why creating safety is not just psychologically comforting but physiologically necessary for healing chronic pain."

She identifies critical gaps in medical education: physicians aren't taught that multiple symptoms can stem from one dysregulated nervous system, they lack training in effective lifestyle interventions, and they don't understand what nervous system dysregulation actually feels like for patients. The discussion expands with insights from experienced practitioners who emphasize the importance of nervous system flexibility rather than simply reducing sympathetic activation. Several participants share their own journeys toward integrative approaches, often prompted by personal health challenges rather than formal training. The presentation highlights how medical education remains focused on the body as a machine rather than addressing wellness holistically, leaving physicians ill-equipped to help chronic pain patients effectively. GG's powerful testimony demonstrates how understanding the brain's role in pain creation and the nervous system's capacity for change can transform both patient experiences and clinical outcomes."

He demonstrates how visual feedback of physiological data can create powerful behavior change, sharing a case study of a concussed cheerleader who made a life-changing decision after seeing her HRV data. Dr. Gharbo emphasizes two fundamental principles: energy is finite, and most people aren't as calm as they think they are. The presentation explores how resonant frequency breathing (around 5-6 breaths per minute) creates a synchronization between heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure that maximizes HRV and exercises the parasympathetic nervous system. What makes this approach particularly valuable is its accessibility - while biofeedback has existed for decades, modern wearable technology now allows for continuous monitoring and feedback. Dr. Gharbo argues that this approach works for both high performers and patients with various conditions by helping them recognize when they're depleting their energy and cutting corners on recovery. The discussion with other experts reveals the rich history of HRV biofeedback, its scientific underpinnings, and debates about self-regulation versus interactive regulation. For anyone interested in improving performance, recovery, or managing health conditions through autonomic regulation, this presentation offers both scientific depth and practical applications."

      "summary": "Dr. Richard Gevirtz presents a revolutionary understanding of myofascial pain disorders that affects millions of patients worldwide. Through meticulous research, he demonstrates that trigger points—the hallmark of these conditions—are not caused by muscle fatigue or inflammation as commonly believed, but by sympathetic nervous system activation of muscle spindles. His team's groundbreaking work used needle EMG to show dramatic electrical activity in trigger points during stress that could be blocked with sympathetic (but not motor) nerve blockers, confirming the autonomic nature of these pain generators. Perhaps most striking was their finding that a simple 12-minute educational video for whiplash patients reduced pain, healthcare utilization, and narcotic use by over 90% at six months compared to usual care. Dr. Gevirtz explains how combining physical trigger point release techniques with heart rate variability biofeedback at resonance frequency (approximately six breaths per minute) creates a powerful intervention that strengthens vagal tone, inhibits sympathetic activity, and produces increasingly longer-lasting pain relief. This integrated approach addresses both the peripheral pain generators and the central autonomic dysregulation, offering a comprehensive solution for conditions often misdiagnosed as structural problems requiring invasive interventions. The discussion reveals how this work connects with polyvagal theory and has implications beyond musculoskeletal pain to conditions like migraines and epilepsy, highlighting the critical role of autonomic regulation in multiple disorders."

      "summary": "In this illuminating presentation, Dr. Christopher Germer reveals how shame functions as the hidden driver behind many chronic conditions. Drawing on extensive research, he explains that shame isn't just an uncomfortable emotion—it's a physiological threat that increases cortisol and inflammatory markers more significantly than other negative emotions. What makes Dr. Germer's approach revolutionary is his framework for understanding shame through three paradoxes: shame feels blameworthy but is actually innocent; it feels isolating but is universal; and it feels permanent but is temporary. The presentation includes compelling evidence from brain imaging studies showing how a mere 12 hours of self-compassion training reduced chronic back pain and pain-related disability by addressing the shame component that keeps patients trapped in avoidance behaviors. Dr. Germer guides viewers through a powerful 10-minute self-compassion exercise that demonstrates how to transform shame by recognizing it as arising from our fundamental wish to be loved. Healthcare providers will find particular value in understanding how self-compassion differs from mindfulness alone and how it correlates with improved heart rate variability and secure attachment. The discussion with other experts highlights the potential for self-compassion to function as 'portable therapy'—a practical tool patients can use between sessions to regulate their nervous system and create conditions for healing co-regulation with others."

      "summary": "Dr. Richard Gevirtz delivers a fascinating exploration of how we can influence brain function through the body using heart rate variability biofeedback. While psychology has traditionally focused on top-down interventions like cognitive therapy, Dr. Gevirtz highlights the untapped potential of bottom-up approaches that leverage the vagal afferent pathways—the information superhighway carrying signals from our organs to our brain. These pathways, making up 80-90% of vagal fibers, have been largely ignored in conventional treatment approaches. Through his research, Dr. Gevirtz demonstrates how slow, resonant breathing at 4-7 breaths per minute creates powerful oscillations in heart rate that dramatically affect brain function. Using sophisticated measurements like heart period evoked potentials and fMRI, his team has shown that this resonance breathing enhances communication between the heart and multiple brain regions, including those critical for emotional regulation. Perhaps most importantly, regular HRV biofeedback practice strengthens the connection between the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala—a neural pathway essential for managing emotional responses. The clinical implications are profound: by creating a physiological state of safety through these bottom-up techniques, practitioners can make subsequent psychological interventions more effective. As one clinical example shared in the discussion illustrated, patients may experience reduced fear and increased functionality even when pain intensity remains unchanged. Dr. Gevirtz's work offers a compelling bridge between physiological and psychological approaches, suggesting that the most effective interventions address both the body's state of threat and the mind's interpretation of experience."

The speakers share compelling clinical examples of how guiding patients to reconnect with bodily sensations—rather than focusing on narratives or labels—can bypass resistance and access deeper healing. Dr. Porges explains how the social engagement system acts as a neural container that enables optimal experiences and healing to occur, emphasizing that creating safety is fundamental to the healing process. The discussion challenges conventional medical approaches that treat symptoms without addressing the underlying neurophysiological causes, highlighting how every symptom in the body results from the nervous system's processing of environmental cues. Particularly noteworthy is the observation that healing consistently involves processing anger, which serves as a protective mechanism against vulnerability. This presentation offers healthcare providers a transformative framework that bridges cutting-edge neuroscience with practical clinical applications, potentially revolutionizing approaches to pain management and emotional disorders."

Using free association tasks and computational modeling, Fradkin objectively measures thought control mechanisms without relying on subjective self-reporting. His findings reveal two critical insights: first, people primarily use reactive thought control (rejecting thoughts after they arise) rather than proactive control (preventing thoughts from occurring); second, thoughts are naturally self-reinforcing – thinking something once makes it more likely to recur in similar contexts. Most importantly, Fradkin discovered that people with better thought control can partially mitigate this self-reinforcing effect, explaining why some individuals experience fewer repetitive thoughts than others. The discussion expanded to explore connections between thought patterns and physiological states, with experts suggesting that autonomic nervous system dysregulation might contribute to obsessive thinking disorders. Fradkin hypothesizes that acceptance-based approaches may work better than deliberate suppression because they enhance natural proactive control mechanisms rather than interfering with them. This research offers promising new directions for understanding and treating conditions characterized by intrusive thoughts, including OCD, anxiety, and depression, by objectively measuring the mechanisms that make certain thoughts so difficult to control."
