# DHG Development Process Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the design, build, and iteration process for the DHG application ecosystem. It serves as a reference for development practices, architectural decisions, and technical dependencies. This specification can be used to evaluate existing documentation against current development practices to identify gaps and prioritize documentation efforts.

## Development Paradigm

Our development approach follows a pragmatic, component-based methodology focused on rapid iteration and functional deliverables. Key aspects include:

1. **Component-First Development**: Building discrete, reusable UI components that can be composed into complex interfaces
2. **Debug-Driven Development**: Implementing extensive debugging capabilities throughout components to aid in development
3. **Incremental Enhancement**: Starting with minimal viable functionality and iteratively enhancing based on feedback
4. **Documentation Through Demonstration**: Creating working examples that serve as both development artifacts and documentation

## Technical Stack

4. **Navigation Flow**: Define and implement navigation between pages

### 3. Data Integration

1. **Schema Definition**: Define database schema for required entities
2. **Query Implementation**: Create typed queries for data retrieval
3. **Mutation Implementation**: Implement data modification operations
4. **Caching Strategy**: Define appropriate caching mechanisms for improved performance

### 4. External Integrations

1. **Authentication Flow**: Implement user authentication and session management
2. **Google Drive Integration**: Set up synchronization with document sources
3. **AI Processing Flow**: Implement pipelines for document analysis and content extraction
4. **Metadata Synchronization**: Maintain consistency between external data and local storage

### 5. Testing and Validation

1. **Component Testing**: Verify component behavior in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Validate interactions between components
3. **User Flow Testing**: Ensure complete user journeys function as expected
4. **Performance Validation**: Check for performance bottlenecks and optimize as needed

### 6. Iteration and Refinement

1. **Feedback Collection**: Gather user feedback on implemented features
2. **Issue Identification**: Document bugs, edge cases, and limitations
3. **Enhancement Planning**: Prioritize improvements based on impact and effort
4. **Implementation Cycle**: Apply changes in small, focused iterations

## Component Taxonomy

### UI Components

- **Layout Components**: Page structure, navigation, and content organization
- **Form Components**: User input collection and validation
- **Display Components**: Data visualization and presentation
- **Interactive Components**: User interaction and feedback

### Functional Components

- **Data Fetching**: API integration and data retrieval
- **State Management**: Application state handling
- **Authentication**: User identity and access control
- **Processing**: Data transformation and analysis

### Integration Components

- **Google Drive**: Document synchronization and retrieval
- **AI Processing**: Content analysis and extraction
- **Batch Processing**: Background task management
- **Notification**: User alerting and feedback

## Development Practices

### Code Organization

- **Component Modularity**: Each component should have a single responsibility
- **Typed Interfaces**: All component props and state should be typed
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions
- **Archival Practice**: Deprecated code is archived with date suffixes (Component.YYYY-MM-DD.tsx)

### Styling Approach

- **Utility-First**: Prefer Tailwind utility classes for styling
- **Component Variants**: Use variants for component state variations
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first responsive layouts
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### State Management

- **Local State**: Use useState for component-specific state
- **Shared State**: Use useContext for cross-component state sharing
- **API State**: Use SWR or React Query for server state management
- **Form State**: Use controlled components for form inputs

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Components should handle error states elegantly
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages to users
- **Logging**: Log errors for debugging purposes
- **Recovery**: Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate

## Conclusion

This specification describes our current development process, emphasizing component-based design, incremental enhancement, and extensive debugging capabilities. By evaluating existing documentation against this specification, we can identify gaps and prioritize documentation efforts to better support ongoing development.

Documentation should focus on providing practical guidance, code examples, and clear explanations of design decisions to facilitate both current development and future maintenance.
